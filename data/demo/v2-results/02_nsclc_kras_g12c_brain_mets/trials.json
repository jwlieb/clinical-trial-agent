      "summary": "Lungs are made up of individual lobes. When a lung cancer tumour is detected in one of these lobes, surgeons typically perform a Lobectomy. A Lobectomy is the surgery most commonly done to treat early-stage lung cancer and requires removal of an entire lobe of the lung, which removes a large amount of lung tissue For patients with small tumours saving as much healthy lung tissue as possible is important. Each lobe of the lung has smaller sections called segments. When a lung cancer is in one of these segments, it is possible to remove that segment, without removing the entire lobe. This surgery is called a segmentectomy. Compared to a lobectomy, a segmentectomy saves a larger amount of healthy lung tissue.\n\nWith the advances in screening technology for lung cancer tumours, an increasing amount of very small lung cancer tumours are being found, and the demand for segmentectomy is increasing. A segmentectomy is a hard surgery to perform robotically because it is difficult to view the tissue lines that separate each segment within the lobe. As a result, it is difficult for the surgeon to see exactly which pieces of tissue should be removed. Because of these challenges, many patients having robotic surgery will have a lobectomy, even if a full lobectomy is not needed.\n\nNear-Infrared Fluorescence (NIF) using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent dye is a recent advancement in the robotic platform of robotic surgery. The surgeon will view the CT scan to determine which segment the tumour is located in. Once identified, the surgeon will isolate the segment by cutting off the blood supply to that segment. Then ICG will be injected into a vein. It is expected that the entire lung, except the isolated segment, which will remain 'dark' as it was isolated from blood supply, will fluoresce, giving off a green hue when viewed with the da Vinci Firefly camera. The surgeon will identify 'dark' segment, and will remove it. A pathologist will examine the excised tissue to ensure that the tumour was removed in its entirety. Once confirmed, the surgeon will end the procedure. If the pathologist determines that the segment removed did not contain the entire tumour, then the surgeon will perform a routine lobectomy. This ensures patient safety and confirms that all participants will have the entire tumour removed from their lung.",

NK cells, white blood cells important to the immune system, are donated/collected from cord blood collected at birth from healthy babies and grown in the lab. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving NK cells together with cyclophosphamide and etoposide may work better in treating children and young adults with solid tumors.",

To participate in LUNGMAP, patients must be registered to Step 1 after evaluation of patient eligibility, including tumor tissue adequacy, per protocol Section 5.1, Step 1.\n\n   Patients registered at Step 0 must use the same SWOG patient ID for registration at Step 1.\n\n   Step 1:\n2. Patients must have pathologically proven non-small cell lung cancer (all histologic types) confirmed by tumor biopsy and/or fine-needle aspiration. Disease must be Stage IV as defined in Section 4.0, or recurrent. The primary diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer should be established using the current WHO/IASLC-classification of Thoracic Malignancies. All histologies, including mixed, are allowed.\n3. Patients must either be eligible to be screened at progression on prior treatment or to be pre-screened prior to progression on current treatment.\n\n   These criteria are:\n   1. Screening at progression on prior treatment:\n\n      To be eligible for screening at progression, patients must have received at least one line of systemic therapy for any stage of disease (Stages I-IV) and must have progressed during or following their most recent line of therapy.\n      * For patients whose prior systemic therapy was for Stage I-III disease only (i.e. patient has not received any treatment for Stage IV or recurrent disease), disease progression on platinum-based chemotherapy must have occurred within one year from the last date that patient received that therapy. For patients treated with consolidation anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy for Stage III disease, disease progression on consolidation anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy must have occurred within one year from the date or initiation of such therapy.\n      * For patients whose prior therapy was for Stage IV or recurrent disease, the patient must have received at least one line of a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, alone or in combination (e.g. Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab).\n   2. Pre-Screening prior to progression on current treatment:\n\n   To be eligible for pre-screening, current treatment must be for Stage IV or recurrent disease and patient must have received at least one dose of the current regimen. Patients must have previously received or currently be receiving a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, alone or in combination (e.g. Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab). Patients on first-line treatment are eligible upon receiving Cycle 1, Day 1 infusion.

If archival tumor material is exhausted, then a new fresh tumor biopsy that is formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) must be obtained. Patients who need the fresh biopsy must also submit whole peripheral blood for ctDNA testing. A tumor block or FFPE slides 4-5 microns thick must be submitted. Bone biopsies are not allowed. If FFPE slides are to be submitted, at least 12 unstained slides plus an H\\&E stained slide, or 13 unstained slides must be submitted. However, it is strongly recommended that 20 FFPE slides be submitted. Note: Previous next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) will be repeated if done outside this study for sub-study assignment.\n\n   Patients must agree to have any tissue that remains after testing retained for the use of sub-study Translational Medicine (TM) studies at the time of consent the patient is enrolled in.\n5. Patients with known EGFR sensitizing mutations, EGFR T790M mutation, ALK gene fusion, ROS 1 gene rearrangement, or BRAF V600E mutation are not eligible unless they have progressed following all standard of care targeted therapy. EGFR/ALK/ROS/BRAF testing is not required prior to Step 1 registration, as it is included in the Foundation One testing for screening/pre-screening.\n6.

In addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"effective contraception\" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation. However, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures\n* Patients who speak and understand English or French must agree to participate in cognitive function testing\n* Patient must be offered the opportunity to have specimens submitted for banking\n* Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines\n* As a part of the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN) randomization process the treating institution?s identity is provided in order to ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered in the system",

Existing tests for monitoring EGFR expression are invasive and not reliable. There needs to be a better way to measure EGFR expression in cancerous tumors to better tailor cancer treatments.\n\nThis clinical trial aims to demonstrate the feasibility of imaging cancers that express EGFR using 89Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab and Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computerized Tomography (CT). By non-invasively imaging the status of EGFR, 89Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab could be used to assist in the identification of patients who are likely to respond to anti-EGFR treatments, including nimotuzumab. The hypothesis is that 89Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab will accumulate to tumors over-expressing EGFR making them visible when imaged with PET/CT. This hypothesis will be tested in this study, along with the optimal imaging time and diagnostic ability.",

      "summary": "This collaborative screening protocol, developed by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) and supported by the Thoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG), is designed to determine the feasibility of comprehensive molecular profiling to detect actionable oncogenic drivers in patients with suspected early stage lung cancers scheduled to undergo biopsies to establish the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\nThe primary purpose of this testing is to determine the presence of 12 oncogenic drivers (mutations in EGFR, BRAFV600E , MET exon 14, KRAS G12C and HER2, rearrangements in ALK, RET, NTRK, EGFR exon 20 insertion and ROS1, and amplification of MET and HER2) that can serve as targets making patients eligible for upcoming targeted neoadjuvant therapy trials. The ultimate goal is to use this information from the screening process to select the optimal neoadjuvant therapy and wherever possible enroll patients onto separate neoadjuvant therapy trials with genomically matched treatments or other appropriate trials if no actionable driver mutation is detected.\n\nThoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG) is a network of surgeons within North American Thoracic Surgery Academic Centers aligned with the goal of enhancing patient care through administration of multi-site trials focused on recent advances in lung cancer. TSOG has aligned with the LCMC4 sites to enroll the LCRF-LEADER screening trial. TSOG's involvement will be essential in trial enrollment and ultimate interpretation of the multimodal clinical and translational data collected as part of this study. We estimate we will detect an actionable oncogenic driver in 33% of cases. The remaining 66% of patients will represent a cohort identified by their care teams as candidates for other potential neoadjuvant therapies which may include checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab or other novel agents.\n\nThe targeted therapy treatment trials will be conducted independently of the LCRF-LEADER screening trial, evaluating for efficacy. If none of the 10 oncogenic drivers are detected, the patient will be offered participation in any clinical trial of neoadjuvant therapy available at their treating institution or standard of care therapy. For patients not enrolled on a targeted treatment trial, circulating tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA) will be collected at 3 time points: before neoadjuvant treatment, after neoadjuvant treatment but before surgery, and after surgery. This initiative will be correlated with various clinical outcomes. Prespecified clinical data will be collected for correlation with these circulating biomarkers.",

These issues, combined with side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, have detrimental effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). On a deeper level, there is the problem of an ongoing failure to integrate and evaluate the best of what complementary medicine has to offer surgical oncology care. Too many clinical trials focus on single agent therapies, rather than broad multi-faceted individualized and integrative care interventions that are used in real world settings.\n\nThe Thoracic POISE project has the overarching goal of improving care for thoracic cancer patients by impacting HRQoL, reducing surgical adverse events, prolonging overall survival and pioneering integrative care delivery.",

      "summary": "This phase II/III trial compares the effect of immunotherapy with atezolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus standard therapy alone for the treatment of poorly differentiated extrapulmonary (originated outside the lung) neuroendocrine cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). The other aim of this trial is to compare using atezolizumab just at the beginning of treatment versus continuing it beyond the initial treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cisplatin and carboplatin are in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds that work by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill cancer cells. Giving atezolizumab in combination with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide may work better in treating patients with poorly differentiated extrapulmonary neuroendocrine cancer compared to standard therapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide alone.",

The secondary objectives are to estimate the progression free survival (PFS) of pooled mutant-KRAS long peptide vaccine with poly-ICLC adjuvant in combination with Ipilimumab + Nivolumab for the first line treatment of patients with unresectable Stage III/IV NSCLC whose tumors harbor selected KRAS mutations (KRAS glycine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 12 (G12C), KRAS glycine-to-valine substitution at codon 12 (G12V), KRAS glycine-to-Detoxglyphosate substitution at codon 12 (G12D), KRAS glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 12 (G12A), KRAS glycine-to-Aspartic Acid \"D\" at codon 13 (G13D) or KRAS G12R) and to assess the impact of predicted KRAS mutations on mutant-KRAS specific T cell responses in the peripheral blood of these patients. Exploratory objectives will assess the impact of predicted KRAS mutations on mutant-KRAS specific T cell responses in the peripheral blood, as well as changes in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA). Approximately 15 subjects will be enrolled to have 12 evaluable subjects for T cell response assessment. Safety analysis will include all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of vaccine. The evaluable population for T cell response will consist of all patients who receive at least one dose of vaccine and have baseline and post-treatment T cell measures in the peripheral blood at 12 weeks.",

Radiation therapy is a standard cancer treatment that uses high energy rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Split-course adaptive radiation therapy uses patient disease response to alter the intensity of the radiation therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, cemiplimab, atezolizumab or nivolumab may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs like carboplatin, pemetrexed, and paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving split-course adaptive radiation therapy with standard treatments like immunotherapy and chemotherapy may be more effective at treating stage IV or locally advanced lung cancer than giving them alone.",

      "summary": "This clinical trial is studying advanced solid tumors. Solid tumors are cancers that start in a part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once tumors have grown bigger in one place but haven't spread, they're called locally advanced. If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body, it's called metastatic. When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.\n\nParticipants in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment. Participants must have a solid tumor cancer that can't be treated with standard of care drugs.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called PF-08046050. PF-08046050 is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.\n\nThis study will test the safety of PF-08046050 in participants with solid tumors that are hard to treat or have spread throughout the body.\n\nThis study has 5 different study parts. Part A and Part B of the study will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if PF-08046050 is safe and if it works to treat certain solid tumor cancers. Part D and E of the study, together with information from Parts A and B, will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Part E will use the information from Parts A, B, and D to see if PF-08046050 is safe in combination with other anti-cancer agents and if it works to treat a certain solid tumor.",

Carfilzomib is a drug that binds to and inhibits the activity of the protein complex that is responsible for degrading other damaged or unneeded proteins. The inhibition of this protein by carfilzomib can then cause tumor growth inhibition and cell death. Sotorasib is a drug that binds to and inhibits the activity of the KRAS G12C mutant. This may inhibit growth in KRAS G12C-expressing tumor cells. Combining carfilzomib and sotorasib may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC.",

Pancreas is a long, flat gland that lies in the abdomen behind the stomach. Pancreas creates enzymes that help with digestion. It also makes hormones that can help control your blood sugar levels.\n\nAll participants in this study will take the study medication (PF-07934040) as pill by mouth twice a day repeating for 21-day or 28-day cycles.\n\nDepending on which part of the study participants are enrolled into they will receive the study medication (PF-07934040 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer medications). These anti-cancer medications will be given in the study clinic by intravenous (IV) that is directly injected into the veins at various times (depending on the treatment) during the 21-day or 28-day cycle.\n\nParticipants can continue to take the study medication (PF-07934040) and the combination anti-cancer therapy until their cancer is no longer responding.\n\nThe study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help see if the study medicines are safe and effective.\n\nParticipants will be involved in this study for up to 4 years. During this time, they will come into the clinic between 1 to 4 times in each 21-day or 28-day cycle. After they have stopped taking the study medication (at about at 2 years) they will be followed for another two years to see how they are doing.",

Reinforced staplers are designed to make the staple line stronger and reduce the risk of PAL. However, investigators don't know if they are better than standard staplers, especially in a specific type of lung surgery called fissureless lobectomy for lung cancer. This study aims to find out if reinforced staplers are more effective at reducing PAL and its complications compared to non-reinforced staplers.\n\nReinforced staplers have been used in lung surgeries and have shown to reduce PAL. For example, staplers with special materials like polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets have shown lower air leakage and fewer days with chest tubes. Other materials like expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) sleeves have also been used to manage air leaks in different types of lung surgeries. However, their effectiveness in fissureless lobectomy has not been studied yet.",

In regions where PD-L1 (TPS \u226550%) testing by 22C3 pharmDx is not considered SOC, PD-L1 expression levels will be determined by central testing (minimum of 6 slides).\n6. Has provided a formalin-fixed tumor tissue sample for the assessment of biomarkers. This tissue requirement is in addition to the tissue required for PD-L1 testing for tissue screening purposes. If a documented law or regulation prohibits (or does not approve) sample collection, then such sample will not be collected.\n7. Has an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 at Screening.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria\n\n1. Has received prior treatment with any of the following, including in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting:\n\n   1. Any anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX40, or CD137).\n   2. Has previously been treated with any enhancer of zeste homolog inhibitors.\n2. Participants who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy other than those listed in the exclusion criterion above are eligible if the adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy was completed at least 6 months prior to the current diagnosis of advanced or metastatic disease.\n3. Has received a live vaccine or live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial intervention. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, and typhoid vaccines. Note: Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.\n4. Has an active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (ie, with use of systemic disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n\n   Inhaled, intranasal, intraocular, intra-articular, or topical steroids and adrenal replacement steroids are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n5. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (at doses exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial intervention. Note: Short-course systemic corticosteroids (eg, prevention of/treatment for transfusion reaction) or steroid use for a noncancer indication (eg, adrenal replacement) is permissible.\n6. Has a known active or untreated CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate, provided they are radiologically stable (ie, without evidence of progression) for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note: repeat imaging should be performed during trial screening), clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days before the first dose of trial intervention. Note: A CT scan or MRI scan of the brain at Baseline is required for all participants. For participants in whom CNS metastases are first discovered at Screening, the treating investigator should delay trial intervention to complete any necessary treatment followed by a proper washout period and document the stability of CNS metastases with repeat imaging at least 4 weeks later (in which case repetition of all screening activities may be required).\n7. Has uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including the following:\n\n   1. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula \\>470 ms (based on the average of screening triplicate 12-lead ECG determinations)\n   2. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Screening\n   3. Uncontrolled angina pectoris within 6 months prior to Screening\n   4. New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure\n   5. Uncontrolled hypertension (resting systolic blood pressure \\>160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\>100 mmHg)\n8. Has a history of (noninfectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at Screening.\n9. Has a history of radiation pneumonitis.\n10. Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests the safety and effectiveness of the combination of grid radiation therapy and standard of care (SOC) immunotherapy in treating patients with stage IV non-small lung cancer (NSCLC). Conventional radiation therapy treatments typically deliver the same radiation dose to the entire tumor. Spatially fractionated radiation therapy or grid therapy is approved and a technique which permits the delivery of high doses of radiation to small regions of the tumor which can lead to enhanced tumor cell killing. Grid therapy has been shown to produce dramatic relief of severe symptoms, significant tumor regression (decrease in the size of a tumor), and above average local control rates often exceeding those expected with conventionally delivered radiation treatments, all with minimal associated toxicity. Immunotherapy has become combined into treating patients, which has led improvements in survival and quality of life. Immunotherapy is now the cornerstone of SOC therapy for stage IV NSCLC. Grid radiation therapy combined with immunotherapy may be safe and effective in treating patients with stage IV NSCLC.",

      "summary": "This phase I/II trial tests the safety, side effects and best dose of sotorasib with trastuzumab deruxtecan and how well the combination works in treating patients with KRAS G12C mutated non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Sotorasib blocks a protein made by the mutated KRAS gene (KRAS p.G12C), which may help keep tumor cells from growing and may kill them. It is a type of targeted therapy. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is in a class of medications called antibody-drug conjugates. It is composed of a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive tumor cells in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Giving sotorasib in combination with trastuzumab deruxtecan may be safe, tolerable, and/or effective in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a KRAS G12C mutation.",

For this reason and because HER-2-directed antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use dual methods of contraception and must have a negative serum pregnancy testing at screening. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception, if sexually active, or avoid intercourse during the study treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of study drug. Sotorasib (AMG-510) may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method on study and for an additional 7 days after the last dose of sotorasib (AMG-510). Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use a highly effective barrier method of contraception, if sexually active, or avoid intercourse throughout the duration of the study and for 4 months following the last dose of study drug. To prevent exposure of the unborn child to sotorasib (AMG-510) through semen, male subjects will be required to practice true sexual abstinence (not have sex) or must wear a condom during vaginal sex\n* Women of non-child-bearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle-stimulating hormone \\[FSH\\] \\> 40 mIU/mL and estradiol \\< 40 pg/mL \\[\\< 147 pmol/L\\] is confirmatory) are eligible. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods outlined for women of child-bearing potential if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method\n* Male subjects must not freeze or donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the study period, and at least 4 months after the final study drug administration. Preservation of sperm should be considered prior to enrollment in this study\n* Female subjects must not donate, or retrieve for their own use, ova from the time of screening and throughout the study treatment period, and for at least 7 months after the final study drug administration\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Legally authorized representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD) that required steroids, has current ILD, or where suspected ILD cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening. These patients will be excluded because trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) is known to increase the risk of developing ILD and pneumonitis\n* Patients with clinically severe pulmonary compromise resulting from intercurrent pulmonary illnesses including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (i.e., pulmonary emboli within three months of the study enrollment, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \\[COPD\\], restrictive lung disease, prior complete pneumonectomy), and any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's, sarcoidosis, etc.) where there is documented or a suspicion of pulmonary involvement or pneumonectomy at the time of screening. These patients will be excluded because trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) is known to increase the risk of developing ILD and pneumonitis\n* Patients who have had chest radiation therapy within 4 weeks (2 weeks for palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy). These patients will be excluded because trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) and sotorasib (AMG-510) are known to increase the risk of developing pneumonitis\n* Patients who have had a major surgery and are not yet fully healed from surgical incisions\n* Patients who have had prior treatment with an antibody drug conjugate with a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload (i.e., sacituzumab govitecan, datopotomab deruxtecan, or trastuzumab deruxtecan) or with a topoisomerase inhibitor\n* Patients with a history of significant lung disease requiring systemic corticosteroids treatment (\\> 10 mg of prednisone daily) within the last six months of registration\n* Based on pre-clinical data, trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) is associated with corneal disease. Patients with clinically significant corneal disease, in the opinion of the investigator, will be excluded from this study\n* Patients with spinal cord compression, defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring therapy with corticosteroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms\n* Patients with an uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1) with the exception of alopecia. Subjects with chronic grade 2 toxicities (i.e., defined as no worsening to \\> grade 2 for at least 3 months prior to first exposure to study intervention and managed with standard of care treatment) may be eligible per the discretion of the investigator after consultation with the sponsor medical monitor or designee (e.g., grade 2 chemotherapy-induced neuropathy). Subjects should no longer be symptomatic nor require treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone \\> 10 mg or equivalent) or anticonvulsants and must have recovered from the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to sotorasib (AMG-510), such as adagrasib, or trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a)\n* Patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies\n* Patients who are taking strong CYP3A4 inducers should be switched to an alternative drug\n* Avoid coadministration with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious toxicities. If coadministration cannot be avoided, dose adjustment of the substrate may be required. Please refer to the prescribing information for the substrate\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any other significant condition(s) that would make participation in this protocol unreasonably hazardous or interfere with the evaluation of the clinical study results\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) is a HER2-directed antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a). These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease (i.e., history of myocardial infarction within 6 months from screening, symptomatic congestive heart failure \\[CHF\\] \\[New York Heart Association class II to IV\\], troponin levels consistent with myocardial infarction 28 days prior to enrollment, history of unstable angina, or serious cardiac arrhythmia)\n* Patients with prior history of pneumonitis grade 2 or higher or ILD\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients unable to receive both iodinated contrast for CT scans and gadolinium contrast for MRI scans\n* Patients that have pleural effusion, ascites, or pericardial effusion that requires drainage within 2 weeks of study screening procedures, peritoneal shunt, or cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART)\n* Patients that have received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug will be excluded. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, bacillus Calmette- Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed",

      "summary": "Genes contain genetic code which tell the body which proteins to make. Many types of cancer are caused by changes, or mutations, in a gene called KRAS. Researchers are looking for ways to stop the actions of abnormal proteins made from the mutated KRAS gene.\n\nASP5834 is being studied in people with solid tumors who have certain KRAS gene mutations. Some people with solid tumors of the colon or rectum (colorectal cancer), will be given ASP5834 with panitumumab. Panitumumab is a treatment for colorectal cancer. In this study, the researchers will learn how ASP5834 is processed by and acts upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose of ASP5834 and check for any potential medical problems from the treatment.\n\nThe main aims of this study are to check the safety of ASP5834 given by itself or given with panitumumab, and how well it is tolerated; and to find a suitable dose of ASP5834 given by itself or given with panitumumab.\n\nPeople in this study will be adults with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumors with certain KRAS gene mutations. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The key reasons people cannot take part are if they have specific uncontrollable cancers such as symptomatic or untreated cancers in nervous system, or have a specific heart condition, or infections.\n\nIn this study, ASP5834 is being given to humans for the first time. This is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that they will receive ASP5834 by itself or ASP5834 with panitumumab.\n\nThis study will be in 2 parts:\n\nPart 1 is called Dose Escalation. Different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of either: ASP5834 by itself or ASP5834 with panitumumab. Only people who have colorectal cancer will receive ASP5834 with panitumumab. People with any type of solid tumor will receive ASP5834 by itself. For each dose, all medical problems will be recorded. A medical expert panel will check the results and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP5834. The panel will do this until the planned maximum number of people are treated or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.\n\nPart 2 is called Dose Expansion. Other different small groups of people will receive ASP5834 or ASP5834 with panitumumab. They will receive the most suitable doses worked out from Part 1.\n\nIn both parts of the study, the study treatments ASP5834 and panitumumab will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each study treatment cycle is either 21 days or 28 days long. People will continue study treatment until: they have medical problems from the study treatment they can't tolerate; their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; or they ask to stop study treatment.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic on certain days during their study treatment, with extra visits during the first 2 cycles of study treatment. The study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP5834. Also, people in the study will have a health check. On some visits they will also have scans to check for any changes in their cancer. Tumor samples will be taken at certain visits during study treatment with the option of a tumor sample being taken if people's cancer gets worse or the cancer comes back.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic shortly after stopping treatment for a health check. After this, people will have health checks every couple of months to check the condition of their cancer. The number of visits and checks done will depend on the health of each person and whether they completed their study treatment or not. It is expected that people will be in this study for about 1 year.",
