- **Confidence**: 25%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age is 58 years, which meets the age requirement (>= 18 years)
- ECOG status is 1, which is within the acceptable range (0-2)
- Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC, which aligns with the trial conditions

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has received prior treatments (docetaxel and ramucirumab) while trial is for previously treated patients but not specified otherwise
- Patient's PD-L1 expression is <1%, which does not meet the trial's requirements for PD-L1 expression confirmation

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches, but they have previously received treatment and have a PD-L1 expression of <1%, leading to significant doubts about eligibility.

### [NCT05800587](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05800587)

**Phase II Study of Dose Attenuated Chemotherapy in Patients With Lung Cancer and Age > 70 and/or Comorbidities**

- **Sponsor**: Fox Chase Cancer Center
- **Phase**: Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 25%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has metastatic NSCLC (adenocarcinoma), which is included in the study conditions.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient is not treatment-naive; failed first-line therapies (docetaxel, ramucirumab).
- PD-L1 TPS <1%, which may be a concern if the study has specific PD-L1 requirements.

**? Uncertainties:**
- No information on specific cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens planned for the patient.
- No specific details on other comorbidities or their severity in relation to trial eligibility.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type (NSCLC) aligns with the trial's conditions. However, the patient is not treatment-naive due to prior therapies, which conflicts with the requirement for previously treated patients. Additionally, the low PD-L1 status adds an element of uncertainty regarding eligibility.

### [NCT06881784](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06881784)

**RASolve 301: Phase 3 Multicenter, Open Label, Randomized Study of RMC-6236 Versus Docetaxel in Patients With Previously Treated Locally Advanced or Metastatic RAS[MUT] NSCLC**

- **Sponsor**: Revolution Medicines, Inc.
- **Phase**: Phase 3
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 20%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- ECOG status is 1
- Pathologically confirmed NSCLC
- Documented RAS mutation status (KRAS G12C)

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Prior therapy with docetaxel, which is excluded by the trial
- Prior therapy with ramucirumab, which is excluded by the trial

**? Uncertainties:**
- Adequate organ function is not explicitly confirmed
- Co-morbidities or significant cardiovascular issues are not fully detailed

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type (NSCLC) matches the trial criteria, but she has prior therapy with docetaxel and ramucirumab, which excludes her from the trial. There are further uncertainties regarding her organ function and comorbidities.

### [NCT05254184](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05254184)

**Pooled Mutant KRAS-Targeted Long Peptide Vaccine Combined With Nivolumab and Ipilimumab for Patients With Advanced KRAS Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer**

- **Sponsor**: Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 20%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has metastatic NSCLC (adenocarcinoma) which is a targeted condition for the trial.
- Patient has KRAS G12C mutation which is required for the trial.
- ECOG status of 1 is acceptable for trial eligibility.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient is not treatment-naive as they have received prior therapies: docetaxel and ramucirumab which contradicts the trial's requirement for no prior therapy for the same stage of disease.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type aligns with the trial's focus on KRAS mutated NSCLC. However, the patient has previously received treatment which conflicts with the trial's requirement for treatment-naive participants, leading to a likely exclusion.

### [NCT06131840](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06131840)

**An Open-label Phase 1 Study to Investigate PF-08046050 (SGN-CEACAM5C) in Adults With Advanced Solid Tumors**

- **Sponsor**: Seagen, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 20%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has NSCLC which is a target tumor type in the trial.
- ECOG status is 1.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has already received prior systemic therapy (docetaxel/ramucirumab). This trial requires no appropriate standard therapy available.
- PD-L1 TPS <1% does not meet the requirement for receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Molecular requirements related to additional biomarkers if mentioned in trial specifics.
- Details on organ function or standard lab results are not provided.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type (NSCLC) fits the trial's criteria. However, the patient has previously been treated, which disqualifies them given the trial's requirement for having no appropriate standard therapy available. This leads to a clear exclusion based on treatment history.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Measurable disease status** (per RECIST 1.1) - required for most therapeutic trials
- **Life expectancy estimate** - many trials require ≥3 months
- **Cardiac status/QTc interval** - relevant for trials with cardiotoxicity risk
