      "summary": "Background:\n\nThe NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. Researchers want to know if TIL shrink s tumors in people with digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial cancers. In this study, we are selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can cause digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Adults age 18-72 with upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, breast, ovarian/endometrial cancer, or glioblastoma refractory to standard chemotherapy.\n\nDesign:\n\nWork up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed.\n\nSurgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.\n\nLeukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. (Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.)\n\nTreatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.\n\nFollow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, and temsirolimus, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The NovoTTF-100L(P) system is a portable device that uses electrical fields to stop the growth of tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody therapy while using the NovoTTF-100L(P) system may kill more tumor cells.",

Also, children age 12-17 with a solid tumor (other than a muscle tumor) with no standard therapy options.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\n* blood tests\n* physical exam\n* documentation of disease confirmation or tumor biopsy\n* electrocardiogram to evaluate the heart\n* review of their medicines and their ability to do their normal activities\n\nParticipants will take metarrestin by mouth until they cannot tolerate it or stop to benefit from it. They will keep a medicine diary.\n\nParticipants will visit the Clinical Center. During the first month there are two brief hospital stays required with visits weekly or every other week thereafter. They will repeat some of the screening tests. They will fill out questionnaires. They will have tests of their cognitive function. They will have an electroencephalogram to record brain activity. They will have a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A CT is a series of X-rays of the body. An MRI uses magnets and radio waves to take pictures of the body.\n\nAdult participants may have tumor biopsies.\n\nParticipants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends.

Drugs used in the chemotherapy, such as trifluridine/tipiracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Talazoparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving talazoparib with trifluridine/ tipiracil may inhibit certain enzymes in the cells that are responsible for tumor cell growth.",

      "summary": "This collaborative screening protocol, developed by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) and supported by the Thoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG), is designed to determine the feasibility of comprehensive molecular profiling to detect actionable oncogenic drivers in patients with suspected early stage lung cancers scheduled to undergo biopsies to establish the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\nThe primary purpose of this testing is to determine the presence of 12 oncogenic drivers (mutations in EGFR, BRAFV600E , MET exon 14, KRAS G12C and HER2, rearrangements in ALK, RET, NTRK, EGFR exon 20 insertion and ROS1, and amplification of MET and HER2) that can serve as targets making patients eligible for upcoming targeted neoadjuvant therapy trials. The ultimate goal is to use this information from the screening process to select the optimal neoadjuvant therapy and wherever possible enroll patients onto separate neoadjuvant therapy trials with genomically matched treatments or other appropriate trials if no actionable driver mutation is detected.\n\nThoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG) is a network of surgeons within North American Thoracic Surgery Academic Centers aligned with the goal of enhancing patient care through administration of multi-site trials focused on recent advances in lung cancer. TSOG has aligned with the LCMC4 sites to enroll the LCRF-LEADER screening trial. TSOG's involvement will be essential in trial enrollment and ultimate interpretation of the multimodal clinical and translational data collected as part of this study. We estimate we will detect an actionable oncogenic driver in 33% of cases. The remaining 66% of patients will represent a cohort identified by their care teams as candidates for other potential neoadjuvant therapies which may include checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab or other novel agents.\n\nThe targeted therapy treatment trials will be conducted independently of the LCRF-LEADER screening trial, evaluating for efficacy. If none of the 10 oncogenic drivers are detected, the patient will be offered participation in any clinical trial of neoadjuvant therapy available at their treating institution or standard of care therapy. For patients not enrolled on a targeted treatment trial, circulating tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA) will be collected at 3 time points: before neoadjuvant treatment, after neoadjuvant treatment but before surgery, and after surgery. This initiative will be correlated with various clinical outcomes. Prespecified clinical data will be collected for correlation with these circulating biomarkers.",

Sotorasib is in a class of medications called KRAS inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells. Panitumumab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells. Giving combination panitumumab and sotorasib may kill more tumor cells in patients with advanced solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutation.",

This trial may help researchers determine if certain diets may improve the anti-cancer effects of radiation therapy and reduce the side-effects of this treatment.

A dose optimization part in adults with NSCLC may follow the dose escalation phase if the sponsor, in consultation with the safety review committee, decides it is necessary to further characterize the optimal dose. However, the study may also proceed directly to the expansion phase. The study population for the Dose Expansion part of the study comprises adults with advanced/metastatic NSCLC with KRAS and/or BRAF mutations, and with Pancreatic Ductal AdenoCarcinoma (PDAC), ColoRectal Cancer (CRC), and Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC) with KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and/or CRAF (RAF1) mutations and alterations. All patients will self-administer S241656 orally in 28-day cycles until disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study.",

      "summary": "This clinical trial is studying advanced solid tumors. Solid tumors are cancers that start in a part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once tumors have grown bigger in one place but haven't spread, they're called locally advanced. If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body, it's called metastatic. When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.\n\nParticipants in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment. Participants must have a solid tumor cancer that can't be treated with standard of care drugs.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called PF-08046050. PF-08046050 is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.\n\nThis study will test the safety of PF-08046050 in participants with solid tumors that are hard to treat or have spread throughout the body.\n\nThis study has 5 different study parts. Part A and Part B of the study will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if PF-08046050 is safe and if it works to treat certain solid tumor cancers. Part D and E of the study, together with information from Parts A and B, will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Part E will use the information from Parts A, B, and D to see if PF-08046050 is safe in combination with other anti-cancer agents and if it works to treat a certain solid tumor.",

This is called metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Most people with mCRC survive only about 2 years.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test the ability of a combination of up to 4 experimental anti-cancer drugs treat mCRC. The names of these drugs are retifanlimab, TriAdeno vaccine, N-803, and SX-682. They are described below.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 years or older with mCRC. Participants must have\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. This includes having a physical exam, blood tests, urine tests, and imaging tests. If signed on to the study, participants will have 2 tumor biopsies. One when starting the study and once about 8 weeks after bring on the study. Participants will receive $500 for each biopsy.\n\nParticipants will be treated with either 3 or 4 drugs and will receive a detailed calendar explaining when each drug is given.\n\nRetifanlimab is given every 4 weeks through an IV (an IV is tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein in the arm). N-803 is injected under the skin on the abdomen every 4 weeks.\n\nTriAdeno vaccine is injected under the skin of the upper arm or thigh once a month for 3 doses and then once every 3 months.\n\nSome participants will also receive a 4th drug. SX-682 is a pill taken by mouth. Participants will take this drug 2 times a day at home for about 3 weeks of each month.\n\nStudy treatment will continue up to 2 years. Follow-up phone calls/emails may continue for 3 more years.",

Carfilzomib is a drug that binds to and inhibits the activity of the protein complex that is responsible for degrading other damaged or unneeded proteins. The inhibition of this protein by carfilzomib can then cause tumor growth inhibition and cell death. Sotorasib is a drug that binds to and inhibits the activity of the KRAS G12C mutant. This may inhibit growth in KRAS G12C-expressing tumor cells. Combining carfilzomib and sotorasib may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC.",

      "summary": "This clinical trial studies whether an intervention that addresses two or more levels of care (multilevel intervention) increases follow-up of abnormal, non-invasive, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test results. The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is a non-invasive, stool-based, CRC screening test. FITs are relatively inexpensive and can be completed at home, for these reasons, it is a preferred method of CRC screening in healthcare settings that care for under-resourced patients or have limited colonoscopy access. For FIT-based CRC screening to be effective, abnormal results must be followed by a colonoscopy, however many patients fail to complete this recommended follow-up test. The multilevel intervention addresses barriers to follow-up colonoscopy at the patient and health system levels of care through a CRC screening patient navigator, an educational video, and transportation assistance. The navigator provides patient support and assistance with colonoscopy scheduling. The educational video addresses identified patient fears around colonoscopies. Transportation assistance is offered after the colonoscopy through a rideshare program to address transportation barriers. Therefore, this multilevel intervention may increase follow-up colonoscopy completion in patients with abnormal FIT results.",

An MCD test measures markers in the blood in order to screen for multiple cancers simultaneously. There is a need to understand how MCDs may work as cancer screening tools. The goal of cancer screening is to reduce the burden of cancer by identifying cancers before they show symptoms or signs, when treatment is likely to be most effective. In this study, adults aged 45-75 without cancer will be randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: 2 separate MCD test groups or a control group. These two MCD tests will not be compared to each other but will be compared to cancers detected in the control group. This study will provide early information on how well MCD tests perform as cancer screening tools. It will also help researchers understand how patients and their doctors make decisions about their care when the MCD test result comes back as normal (negative) or abnormal (positive).",

      "summary": "Genes contain genetic code which tell the body which proteins to make. Many types of cancer are caused by changes, or mutations, in a gene called KRAS. Researchers are looking for ways to stop the actions of abnormal proteins made from the mutated KRAS gene.\n\nASP5834 is being studied in people with solid tumors who have certain KRAS gene mutations. Some people with solid tumors of the colon or rectum (colorectal cancer), will be given ASP5834 with panitumumab. Panitumumab is a treatment for colorectal cancer. In this study, the researchers will learn how ASP5834 is processed by and acts upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose of ASP5834 and check for any potential medical problems from the treatment.\n\nThe main aims of this study are to check the safety of ASP5834 given by itself or given with panitumumab, and how well it is tolerated; and to find a suitable dose of ASP5834 given by itself or given with panitumumab.\n\nPeople in this study will be adults with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumors with certain KRAS gene mutations. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The key reasons people cannot take part are if they have specific uncontrollable cancers such as symptomatic or untreated cancers in nervous system, or have a specific heart condition, or infections.\n\nIn this study, ASP5834 is being given to humans for the first time. This is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that they will receive ASP5834 by itself or ASP5834 with panitumumab.\n\nThis study will be in 2 parts:\n\nPart 1 is called Dose Escalation. Different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of either: ASP5834 by itself or ASP5834 with panitumumab. Only people who have colorectal cancer will receive ASP5834 with panitumumab. People with any type of solid tumor will receive ASP5834 by itself. For each dose, all medical problems will be recorded. A medical expert panel will check the results and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP5834. The panel will do this until the planned maximum number of people are treated or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.\n\nPart 2 is called Dose Expansion. Other different small groups of people will receive ASP5834 or ASP5834 with panitumumab. They will receive the most suitable doses worked out from Part 1.\n\nIn both parts of the study, the study treatments ASP5834 and panitumumab will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each study treatment cycle is either 21 days or 28 days long. People will continue study treatment until: they have medical problems from the study treatment they can't tolerate; their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; or they ask to stop study treatment.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic on certain days during their study treatment, with extra visits during the first 2 cycles of study treatment. The study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP5834. Also, people in the study will have a health check. On some visits they will also have scans to check for any changes in their cancer. Tumor samples will be taken at certain visits during study treatment with the option of a tumor sample being taken if people's cancer gets worse or the cancer comes back.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic shortly after stopping treatment for a health check. After this, people will have health checks every couple of months to check the condition of their cancer. The number of visits and checks done will depend on the health of each person and whether they completed their study treatment or not. It is expected that people will be in this study for about 1 year.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests the impact of biomarkers in predicting initial treatment (first-line) PD1 or PD-L1 (PD\\[L\\]-1)-based immunotherapy response and in selecting second-line treatment in patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Response and survival rates in advanced stage NSCLC, unlike other cancers, rely on response to first-line therapy. Immunotherapy with PD(L)1-based therapy, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. While immunotherapy has improved survival rate, the prognosis remains poor with most patients receiving chemotherapy after immunotherapy. Many types of tumors tend to lose cells or release different types of cellular products including their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which is referred to as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) into the bloodstream before changes can be seen on scans. Health care providers can measure the level of ctDNA in blood or other bodily fluids to determine which patients are at higher risk for disease progression or relapse. The first part of this trial, studying samples of blood and tissue in the laboratory from patients receiving immunotherapy may help doctors learn more about the effects PD(L)1-based therapy on cells. It may also help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment and may help develop new individualized treatment strategies. The second part of this trial also tests the effect of second-line immunotherapy, such as tremelimumab and durvalumab or adagrasib and bevacizumab, in treating patients with NSCLC with specific genetic mutations that is growing, spreading or getting worse (progressive). Tremelimumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Adagrasib, a type of targeted therapy, may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking a protein needed for tumor cell growth and may kill them. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Giving second-line immunotherapy, tremelimumab and durvalumab or adagrasib with bevacizumab, may be safe, tolerable, and/or effective in treating patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with specific genetic mutations.",
