      "summary": "This study is a first in human Phase 1 study that involves patients with a type of cancer called HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) positive cancer.\n\nThis study asks patients to volunteer to take part in a research study investigating the safety and efficacy of using special immune cells called HER2 chimeric antigen receptor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (HER2 specific CAR T cells), in combination with intra-tumor injection of CAdVEC, an oncolytic adenovirus that is designed to help the immune system including HER2 specific CAR T cell react to the tumor.\n\nThe study is looking at combining these two treatments together, because we think that the combination of treatments will work better than each treatment alone. We also hope to learn the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.\n\nIn this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor cells.\n\nInvestigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. Both CAdVEC and HER2-specific autologous CAR T are investigational products. They are not approved by the FDA.",

      "summary": "While cigarette smoking remains the primary cause of most lung cancer cases, lung carcinoma in never smokers account for nearly 20 percent of cases. Never smokers with lung cancer typically present with different molecular profiles from that of smokers, which results in prognostic and therapeutic implications. Molecular changes in NSCLC that have therapeutic significance include mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. These driver mutations typically are present in lung tumors found in never or light smokers.\n\nThe addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel in first-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC showed improved survival compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel alone, 12.3 vs. 10.3 months respectively. Results from the POINTBREAK trial demonstrated that carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab is an alternative option to carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab, with comparable survival but less toxicity. In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a form of treatment that can lead to robust responses in a subset of patients. The PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab have shown prolonged survival in comparison to docetaxel in patients who previously progressed with chemotherapy, irrespective of PD-L1 expression. Thus, this study combines immunotherapeutic agent atezolozumab with an ant-angiogenic agent, bevacizumab, and double platinum therapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed).",

Pre-Screening prior to progression on current treatment:\n\n   To be eligible for pre-screening, current treatment must be for Stage IV or recurrent disease and patient must have received at least one dose of the current regimen. Patients must have previously received or currently be receiving a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, alone or in combination (e.g. Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab). Patients on first-line treatment are eligible upon receiving Cycle 1, Day 1 infusion. Note: Patients will not receive their sub-study assignment until they progress and the LUNGMAP Notice of Progression is submitted.\n4. Patients must have adequate tumor tissue available, defined as \u2265 20% tumor cells and \u2265 0.2 mm3 tumor volume.\n\n   * The local interpreting pathologist must review the specimen.\n   * The pathologist must sign the LUNGMAP Local Pathology Review Form confirming tissue adequacy prior to Step 1 registration.\n\n   Patients must agree to have this tissue submitted to Foundation Medicine for common broad platform CLIA biomarker profiling, PD-L1, and c-MET IHC (see Section 15.2). If archival tumor material is exhausted, then a new fresh tumor biopsy that is formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) must be obtained. Patients who need the fresh biopsy must also submit whole peripheral blood for ctDNA testing. A tumor block or FFPE slides 4-5 microns thick must be submitted. Bone biopsies are not allowed. If FFPE slides are to be submitted, at least 12 unstained slides plus an H\\&E stained slide, or 13 unstained slides must be submitted. However, it is strongly recommended that 20 FFPE slides be submitted. Note: Previous next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) will be repeated if done outside this study for sub-study assignment.\n\n   Patients must agree to have any tissue that remains after testing retained for the use of sub-study Translational Medicine (TM) studies at the time of consent the patient is enrolled in.\n5. Patients with known EGFR sensitizing mutations, EGFR T790M mutation, ALK gene fusion, ROS 1 gene rearrangement, or BRAF V600E mutation are not eligible unless they have progressed following all standard of care targeted therapy. EGFR/ALK/ROS/BRAF testing is not required prior to Step 1 registration, as it is included in the Foundation One testing for screening/pre-screening.\n6. Patients must have Zubrod performance status 0-1 (see Section 10.2) documented within 28 days prior to Step 1 registration.\n7. Patients must be \u2265 18 years of age.\n8. Patients must also be offered participation in banking for future use of specimens as described in Section 15.0.\n9. Patients must be willing to provide prior smoking history as required on the LUNGMAP Onstudy Form.\n10. As a part of the OPEN registration process (see Section 13.4 for OPEN access instructions) the treating institution's identity is provided in order to ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered in the system.\n11. Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.\n12. U.S. patients who can complete the survey and the interview by telephone or email in English must be offered participation in the S1400GEN Survey Ancillary Study if local institution's policies allow participants to receive the Amazon gift card (see Sections 15.7 and 18.5). Patients at institutions that cannot offer the survey must still participate in the main study.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cells and nivolumab together may work better in treating patients with glioblastoma.",

      "summary": "This collaborative screening protocol, developed by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) and supported by the Thoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG), is designed to determine the feasibility of comprehensive molecular profiling to detect actionable oncogenic drivers in patients with suspected early stage lung cancers scheduled to undergo biopsies to establish the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\nThe primary purpose of this testing is to determine the presence of 12 oncogenic drivers (mutations in EGFR, BRAFV600E , MET exon 14, KRAS G12C and HER2, rearrangements in ALK, RET, NTRK, EGFR exon 20 insertion and ROS1, and amplification of MET and HER2) that can serve as targets making patients eligible for upcoming targeted neoadjuvant therapy trials. The ultimate goal is to use this information from the screening process to select the optimal neoadjuvant therapy and wherever possible enroll patients onto separate neoadjuvant therapy trials with genomically matched treatments or other appropriate trials if no actionable driver mutation is detected.\n\nThoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG) is a network of surgeons within North American Thoracic Surgery Academic Centers aligned with the goal of enhancing patient care through administration of multi-site trials focused on recent advances in lung cancer. TSOG has aligned with the LCMC4 sites to enroll the LCRF-LEADER screening trial. TSOG's involvement will be essential in trial enrollment and ultimate interpretation of the multimodal clinical and translational data collected as part of this study. We estimate we will detect an actionable oncogenic driver in 33% of cases. The remaining 66% of patients will represent a cohort identified by their care teams as candidates for other potential neoadjuvant therapies which may include checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab or other novel agents.\n\nThe targeted therapy treatment trials will be conducted independently of the LCRF-LEADER screening trial, evaluating for efficacy. If none of the 10 oncogenic drivers are detected, the patient will be offered participation in any clinical trial of neoadjuvant therapy available at their treating institution or standard of care therapy. For patients not enrolled on a targeted treatment trial, circulating tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA) will be collected at 3 time points: before neoadjuvant treatment, after neoadjuvant treatment but before surgery, and after surgery. This initiative will be correlated with various clinical outcomes. Prespecified clinical data will be collected for correlation with these circulating biomarkers.",

ZEN003694 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better and have a corrected QT (QTc) interval \\< 450 msec\n* The effects of nivolumab, ZEN003694, and/or ipilimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because nivolumab, ZEN003694, and/or ipilimumab are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months after the last dose of investigational drug. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin \\[HCG\\]) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab. Women must not be breastfeeding. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not require contraception.\n\n  * WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL.\n  * WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of investigational product. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days.\n  * Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) should inform the treating physician immediately\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be eligible\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with sarcoma or non-epithelial histology\n* Patients with known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study intervention\n* Prior therapy with PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4 inhibitors, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways. Prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors is allowed in the dose escalation cohort if no grade 2 or more toxicities developed during that therapy requiring stopping immune checkpoint inhibition. Patients who have received prior vaccine therapy are eligible\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to nivolumab, ipilimumab, and/or ZEN003694, including severe hypersensitivity reactions to any monoclonal antibody\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may be enrolled on this study provided: (a) they are on a stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) with no medications otherwise prohibited by this protocol (e.g. drug-drug interactions,), e.g. medications cannot be CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors and cannot interact with ZEN003694), and (b) they require no concurrent antibiotics or antifungals for the prevention of opportunistic infections, and (c) they have a CD4 count above 250 cell/mcL and an undetectable viral load on standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests within 1 month of initiation of study treatment\n* Other patients with clinically significant immunosuppression, e.g. organ transplant patients, are not eligible. If clarification is needed, this may be discussed with the medical monitor. Patients should be excluded if they have a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) indicating acute or chronic infection. Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible\n* Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =\\< 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if =\\< 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted\n* Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need for additional treatment before coming on study\n* Patients with known immune impairment who may be unable to respond to anti-CTLA-4 antibody\n* Bowel obstruction or any condition precluding oral intake. No gastric tube for venting purposes. No significant gastrointestinal disease or fistula\n* Known active hepatitis infections or active infections require IV systemic antibiotics\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or that receive fluoxetine (moderate CYP2C19 inhibitor with a metabolite that potentially causes CYP3A4 inhibition) are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular accident/stroke (\\< 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (\\< 6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (\\>= New York Heart Association Classification class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication\n* Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances: Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: breast cancer in situ, cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab and ipilimumab are immunotherapeutic agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with nivolumab and ipilimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study",

      "summary": "This phase II trial studies the side effects of chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy in treating patients with low-risk HIV-associated anal cancer, and nivolumab after standard of care chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with high-risk HIV-associated anal cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy drugs, such as mitomycin, fluorouracil, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab after standard of care chemotherapy and radiation therapy may help reduce the risk of the tumor coming back.",

      "summary": "This phase II/III trial compares the effect of immunotherapy with atezolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus standard therapy alone for the treatment of poorly differentiated extrapulmonary (originated outside the lung) neuroendocrine cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). The other aim of this trial is to compare using atezolizumab just at the beginning of treatment versus continuing it beyond the initial treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cisplatin and carboplatin are in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds that work by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill cancer cells. Giving atezolizumab in combination with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide may work better in treating patients with poorly differentiated extrapulmonary neuroendocrine cancer compared to standard therapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide alone.",

In Part A of the study, dose escalation is carried out where MTD is evaluated using Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design in subjects with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR-mutation of C797S or T790M. In Part B, dose exploration is carried out to further evaluate the safety of JIN-A02 and to determine the RP2D using 2 preliminary effective dose levels and with the help of a safety review committee (SRC) in advanced NSCLC subjects harboring EGFR mutant C797S or T790M. In Part C dose expansion study, subjects with EGFR mutant who show disease progression after receiving standard anticancer therapy, including approved EGFR-TKI therapy with activity against T790M such as Osimertinib and/or no more than one platinum-based anticancer chemotherapy, are divided into 5 different cohorts based on the EGFR mutation and the anti-tumor activity of JIN-A02 is evaluated. Before enrollment in the study, the EGFR mutant profile is determined using either tumor tissue and/or plasma ctDNA. The profile is determined locally through a test method approved by the sponsor. The sponsor reviews and approves each potential subject for enrollment. Study eligibility evaluation will utilize local test(s).",

Radiation therapy is a standard cancer treatment that uses high energy rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Split-course adaptive radiation therapy uses patient disease response to alter the intensity of the radiation therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, cemiplimab, atezolizumab or nivolumab may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs like carboplatin, pemetrexed, and paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving split-course adaptive radiation therapy with standard treatments like immunotherapy and chemotherapy may be more effective at treating stage IV or locally advanced lung cancer than giving them alone.",

There is a protein called PD-L1 that helps regulate the body's immune system. For patients who have PD-L1+ tumors, immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) is usually added to paclitaxel or carboplatin/gemcitabine as initial treatment. For patients who have PD-L1-negative tumors, chemotherapy alone is used, without immunotherapy. ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs, decitabine and cedazuridine. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ASTX727 with usual treatment approach with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab may be able to shrink or stabilize the tumor for longer than the usual approach alone in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.",

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is an anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody agent, ASTX727 is a hypomethylating agent, and paclitaxel is a class D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab (MK-3475), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab (MK-3475).

      "summary": "This clinical trial is studying advanced solid tumors. Solid tumors are cancers that start in a part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once tumors have grown bigger in one place but haven't spread, they're called locally advanced. If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body, it's called metastatic. When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.\n\nParticipants in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment. Participants must have a solid tumor cancer that can't be treated with standard of care drugs.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called PF-08046050. PF-08046050 is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.\n\nThis study will test the safety of PF-08046050 in participants with solid tumors that are hard to treat or have spread throughout the body.\n\nThis study has 5 different study parts. Part A and Part B of the study will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if PF-08046050 is safe and if it works to treat certain solid tumor cancers. Part D and E of the study, together with information from Parts A and B, will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Part E will use the information from Parts A, B, and D to see if PF-08046050 is safe in combination with other anti-cancer agents and if it works to treat a certain solid tumor.",

The researchers want to see if there are differences between people who've had skin cancer and those who haven't despite having a similar type of skin and history of sun exposure. Since this study is designed to simulate sun exposure to small areas of skin, mild to moderate sunburn and tanned spots at the site of the simulated sunlight exposure is a risk. In addition to simulated sun exposure, patients will also have four 6 mm punch skin biopsies performed. Brief discomfort may be felt when the local painkiller (lidocaine) is injected prior to skin biopsies; however, it is usually minimal. Participation in the study involves 4 visits to the clinic over the course of 4 weeks. Each visit will take no longer than 90 minutes.",

They will have a physical exam. They will have blood tests and imaging scans. They may need to have a new biopsy: A small needle will be used to collect a tissue sample from the tumor.\n\nBoth study drugs are given through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein. If participants have already received a drug like avelumab they will receive only lurbinectedin. If patients have not been previously treated with a drug like avelumab they will receive both lurbinectedin and avelumab. All participants will receive their treatment once every 3 weeks for up to 10 years.

HER2 is a protein that helps cells to grow and divide. A damage (also called mutation) to the building plans (genes) for this protein in cancer cells leads to a production of abnormal HER2 and therefore abnormal cell growth and division.\n\nThe study treatment, BAY 2927088, is expected to block the mutated HER2 protein which may stop the spread of NSCLC.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn how well BAY 2927088 works and how safe it is compared with standard treatment, in participants who have advanced NSCLC with specific genetic changes called HER2 mutations.\n\nThe study participants will receive one of the study treatments:\n\n* BAY 2927088 twice every day as a tablet by mouth, or\n* Standard treatment in cycles of 21 days via infusion (\"drip\") into the vein. The treatment will continue for as long as participants benefit from it without any severe side effects or until they or their doctor decide to stop the treatment.\n\nDuring the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* take imaging scans, including CT, PET, MRI, and X-rays, of different parts of the body to study the spread of cancer\n* check the overall health of the participants by performing tests such as blood and urine tests, and checking\n* heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* perform pregnancy tests for women\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study.

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effectiveness of pembrolizumab and sacituzumab govitecan to standard of care in treating patients with urothelial cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called sacituzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called govitecan. Sacituzumab attaches to TROP2 positive tumor cells in a targeted way and delivers govitecan to kill them. The usual treatment approach is treatment with chemotherapy such as cisplatin, carboplatin, gemcitabine, docetaxel or paclitaxel. Cisplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making deoxyribonucleic acid and may kill tumor cells. Docetaxel is in a class of medications called taxanes. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Giving pembrolizumab and sacituzumab govitecan may be more effective than usual care of carboplatin or cisplatin with gemcitabine, docetaxel or paclitaxel in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.",

Is an adult \u226518 years of age or the minimum legal age (whichever is greater) at the time of informed consent. (Follow local regulatory requirements if the legal age of adult voluntary consent for trial participation is \\>18 years old).\n3. Has histologically documented NSCLC that meets all of the following criteria:\n\n   1. Has no prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease.\n   2. Has Stage IIIB or IIIC disease and is not a candidate for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or Stage IV NSCLC disease at the time of enrollment/randomization (based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer, Eighth Edition). Participants with early-stage NSCLC who have relapsed should be restaged during Screening to ensure their eligibility for the trial.\n   3. Has documented negative test results for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 actionable genomic alterations based on analysis of tumor tissue. If test results for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 are not available, participants are required to undergo testing performed locally for these genomic alterations.\n\n      Participants with squamous NSCLC are only required to undergo EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 testing if they have no history of tobacco smoking or were diagnosed with NSCLC at \\<40 years of age.\n   4. Has no known actionable genomic alterations in NTRK, BRAF, RET, MET, or other actionable oncogenic drivers with locally approved therapies (testing for genomic alterations besides EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 is not required prior to enrollment/randomization). Participants whose tumors harbor KRAS mutations are eligible for the trial.\n4. Has measurable disease on CT or MRI based on local imaging assessment using RECIST v1.1\n5. Has a tumor expressing PD-L1 TPS \u226550% as determined by local testing using 22C3 pharmDx PD-L1 IHC assay. In regions where PD-L1 (TPS \u226550%) testing by 22C3 pharmDx is not considered SOC, PD-L1 expression levels will be determined by central testing (minimum of 6 slides).\n6. Has provided a formalin-fixed tumor tissue sample for the assessment of biomarkers. This tissue requirement is in addition to the tissue required for PD-L1 testing for tissue screening purposes. If a documented law or regulation prohibits (or does not approve) sample collection, then such sample will not be collected.\n7. Has an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 at Screening.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria\n\n1. Has received prior treatment with any of the following, including in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting:\n\n   1. Any anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX40, or CD137).\n   2. Has previously been treated with any enhancer of zeste homolog inhibitors.\n2. Participants who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy other than those listed in the exclusion criterion above are eligible if the adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy was completed at least 6 months prior to the current diagnosis of advanced or metastatic disease.\n3. Has received a live vaccine or live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial intervention. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, and typhoid vaccines. Note: Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.\n4. Has an active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (ie, with use of systemic disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n\n   Inhaled, intranasal, intraocular, intra-articular, or topical steroids and adrenal replacement steroids are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n5. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (at doses exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial intervention. Note: Short-course systemic corticosteroids (eg, prevention of/treatment for transfusion reaction) or steroid use for a noncancer indication (eg, adrenal replacement) is permissible.\n6. Has a known active or untreated CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate, provided they are radiologically stable (ie, without evidence of progression) for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note: repeat imaging should be performed during trial screening), clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days before the first dose of trial intervention. Note: A CT scan or MRI scan of the brain at Baseline is required for all participants. For participants in whom CNS metastases are first discovered at Screening, the treating investigator should delay trial intervention to complete any necessary treatment followed by a proper washout period and document the stability of CNS metastases with repeat imaging at least 4 weeks later (in which case repetition of all screening activities may be required).\n7. Has uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including the following:\n\n   1. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula \\>470 ms (based on the average of screening triplicate 12-lead ECG determinations)\n   2. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Screening\n   3. Uncontrolled angina pectoris within 6 months prior to Screening\n   4. New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure\n   5. Uncontrolled hypertension (resting systolic blood pressure \\>160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\>100 mmHg)\n8. Has a history of (noninfectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at Screening.\n9. Has a history of radiation pneumonitis.\n10. Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests the safety and effectiveness of the combination of grid radiation therapy and standard of care (SOC) immunotherapy in treating patients with stage IV non-small lung cancer (NSCLC). Conventional radiation therapy treatments typically deliver the same radiation dose to the entire tumor. Spatially fractionated radiation therapy or grid therapy is approved and a technique which permits the delivery of high doses of radiation to small regions of the tumor which can lead to enhanced tumor cell killing. Grid therapy has been shown to produce dramatic relief of severe symptoms, significant tumor regression (decrease in the size of a tumor), and above average local control rates often exceeding those expected with conventionally delivered radiation treatments, all with minimal associated toxicity. Immunotherapy has become combined into treating patients, which has led improvements in survival and quality of life. Immunotherapy is now the cornerstone of SOC therapy for stage IV NSCLC. Grid radiation therapy combined with immunotherapy may be safe and effective in treating patients with stage IV NSCLC.",

Part 1a will look at multiple doses of OKN4395 either alone (monotherapy) or with pembrolizumab (combination therapy) administered on day 1 of each 21-day cycle in patients with solid tumors until the participant has disease progression or discontinues for any reason. The dose of OKN4395 will be increased, after each group of 3 or more patients completes their first 3 weeks of treatment and their data is evaluated for safety, with a planned dose range from 10 mg twice a day to 450 mg twice a day through 13 dose levels. Part 1b will evaluate OKN4395 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab administered on day 1 of each 21-day cycle in patients with selected cancer types. Part 1b will comprise 5 cohorts: Cohort 1 in sarcoma (OKN4395 alone), Cohort 2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma (OKN4395 alone), Cohort 3 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Cohort 4 in colorectal cancer, and Cohort 5 in head \\& neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), with cohorts 3 to 5 in combination with pembrolizumab. The monotherapy expansion Cohort 1 will also be used to explore the effect of food on the levels of OKN4395 in the blood. Similarly, Cohort 2 will be used to explore the effect of gastric pH on the levels of OKN4395 in the blood.\n\nThe overall study will enrol approximately 166 participants with up to 54 participants to receive OKN4395 alone and 12 participants to receive OKN4395 in combination with pembrolizumab in Part 1a, and 100 participants in Part 1b split: 40 on monotherapy and 60 on combination therapy.

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests how well cemiplimab and transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 (Y90) SIR-Spheres, registered trademark, works in treating breast cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to the liver (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cemiplimab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. TARE is a treatment that uses radioactive microspheres, such as Y90 SIR-S Spheres, to both cause hepatic artery embolization and to deliver regional radiotherapy. Y90 SIR-S Spheres is an injectable form of the radioisotope yttrium Y 90 encapsulated in resin microspheres. When injected into the artery supplying the tumor, yttrium Y 90 resin microspheres block the tumor blood vessels and deliver the yttrium Y 90 directly to the tumor site, which may kill or slow tumor growth. Giving cemiplimab and Y90 SIR-Spheres by TARE to the tumor in the liver may kill more tumor cells in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",
