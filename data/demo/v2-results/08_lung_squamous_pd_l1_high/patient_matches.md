## Patient Profile

- **Age**: 71
- **Sex**: Male
- **Cancer Type**: squamous cell lung cancer

**Clinical Description**:
> 71-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell lung cancer, no actionable driver mutations identified (EGFR/ALK/ROS1/BRAF wild-type, KRAS wild-type). PD-L1 TPS ≥90%. First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy achieved durable response for 22 months, now progressed with new contralateral lung nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Seeking second-line immunotherapy combinations or novel checkpoint approaches. Former heavy smoker (50 pack-years). COPD on inhalers, no supplemental O2. Mild CKD (eGFR 52). Motivated patient willing to travel for trials.

### [NCT04266730](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04266730)

**Phase I Trial of a Personalized and Adaptive Neoantigen Dose-Adjusted Vaccine Administered Concurrently With Pembrolizumab**

- **Sponsor**: UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Not yet recruiting
- **Confidence**: 85%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has histologically confirmed squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
- ECOG status is 1.
- PD-L1 TPS is ≥90%.
- No active brain metastases.
- Age is over 18 and under 75.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Absence of specific lab results for absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, AST, ALT, total serum bilirubin, and creatinine clearance.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial indication for squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and the line of treatment is appropriate since the patient has previously received pembrolizumab and is seeking second-line therapy. The main criteria are met, though organ function lab results are not provided.
