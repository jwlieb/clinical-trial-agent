In the past year, they cannot have had other types of liver disease that typically result in cirrhosis, liver cancer, or active substance abuse.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will have 2 screening visits.\n* Visit 1: to see if they have or may develop NCPH.\n* Medical history\n* Physical exam\n* Urine and stool studies\n* Abdominal ultrasound\n* Fibroscan. Sound waves measure liver stiffness.\n\n\\<TAB\\>- Visit 2:\n\n* Blood tests\n* Abdominal MRI\n* Echocardiogram\n* Questionnaire\n* Liver blood vessel pressure (hepatic venous portal gradient (HVPG)) measurement. This is done with a small tube inserted in a neck vein.\n* They may have a liver biopsy.\n* All participants will visit the clinic every 6 months for a history, physical exam, and blood tests. They will also repeat some of the screening tests yearly.\n* Participants with NCPH will also have:\n* Upper endoscopy test. A tube inserted in the mouth goes through the esophagus and stomach.\n* At least every 2 years: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.\n* At least every 4 years: testing including HVPG measurements and liver biopsy.\n* Participants without NCPH will also have:\n* Liver biopsy and HVPG measurements to see if they have NCPH.\n* Every 2 years: abdominal MRI and stool studies.\n* The study will last indefinitely.",

      "summary": "This study is a first in human Phase 1 study that involves patients with a type of cancer called HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) positive cancer.\n\nThis study asks patients to volunteer to take part in a research study investigating the safety and efficacy of using special immune cells called HER2 chimeric antigen receptor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (HER2 specific CAR T cells), in combination with intra-tumor injection of CAdVEC, an oncolytic adenovirus that is designed to help the immune system including HER2 specific CAR T cell react to the tumor.\n\nThe study is looking at combining these two treatments together, because we think that the combination of treatments will work better than each treatment alone. We also hope to learn the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.\n\nIn this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor cells.\n\nInvestigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. Both CAdVEC and HER2-specific autologous CAR T are investigational products. They are not approved by the FDA.",

Current treatment of breast cancer uses clinical subtype information (e.g. hormone receptor-positive (HR+)) to help guide treatment options. Breast cancer can also be characterized by molecular subtype, but it is not known if this information is helpful in determining treatment when breast cancer has become metastatic. HARMONY will give the treating physician of each participant the molecular subtype of the tumor based on PAM50 testing. The usefulness of this information will be determined through the physician survey. Finding out the molecular subtype of each tumor also allows the investigators to determine if the molecular subtype is different from what is expected based on the clinical subtype.

One reason for poor outcomes is late diagnosis, as the majority of gastric cancers in the United States are diagnosed at a relatively advanced stage where curative resection is unlikely. Gastric precursors (such as atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia) are precancerous changes to the stomach mucosa which increases risk for subsequent gastric cancer.\n\nThe Gastric Precancerous Conditions Study (GAPS) is an observational study of patients at elevated risk for gastric cancer. Investigators seek to recruit patients from endoscopy unit of Stanford Health Care, a large academic network of hospitals and clinics serving Northern California. Investigators will recruit patients who are both symptomatic (e.g. dyspepsia) and asymptomatic (e.g. referred for screening), and individuals both with known precursor lesions (such as intestinal metaplasia) or at high risk for carrying precursor lesions. A component of the study is long-term follow-up of individuals with gastric precursors. This is to understand their risk factors for histologic progression and regression. During both index and subsequent endoscopies, the study team will collect biospecimens (e.g. blood, saliva, gastric tissue).",

      "summary": "Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) causes chronic cough, throat clearing, hoarseness, and dysphagia and if left untreated can promote the development of laryngeal cancer. More than 20% of the United Stated population suffer from LPR, yet there is no effective medical therapy. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which inhibit gastric acid production but do not prevent reflux events, continue to be prescribed for LPR despite their poor efficacy for this patient population, high cost ($26 billion/year), and associated risks. Pepsin, detected in the airway of these patients and now known to cause laryngeal inflammation and promote disease independent of gastric acid, is a key therapeutic target. We report preclinical studies of select HIV inhibitors that bind to and inhibit pepsin and thus hold promise for the treatment of LPR. In support, a very low incidence of LPR was found in patients taking these drugs compared to the general population. HIV inhibitors are ideal drugs to repurpose because they target a foreign virus. Thus, a repurposing approach can be used to safely perform proof of concept testing of the efficacy of a pepsin inhibitor for LPR. The Specific Aim of this project is to perform a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of fosamprenavirvpills for LPR. Fosamprenavir will be used at the FDA approved, manufacturers recommended dose for HIV for 12 weeks in medically refractory patients with clinically diagnosed moderate/severe LPR and combined multi-channel intraluminal impedance - pH (MII-pH) confirmed laryngeal reflux events. Routine clinical outcome measures for LPR (Reflux Symptom Index, Reflux Finding Score, Voice Handicap Index) will be documented pre- and post-treatment with Oral Fosamprenavir for LPR(n = 52) and placebo (n = 52). Additional research measures will include repeat administration of a newly created Daily Symptom Reflex Diary, as well as an intermittently distributed Patient Global Impression - Static \\& Change scales. There is currently no effective medical therapy for LPR and pepsin is the key therapeutic target. Identification of an FDA approved drug which inhibits pepsin allows for a clinical trial to determine efficacy using a faster and safer repurposing approach to address a significant gap.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial investigates how well trastuzumab deruxtecan works alone or in combination with anastrozole in treating patients with HER2 low, hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 expressed at low levels on cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Anastrozole works by decreasing estrogen production and suppressing the growth of tumors that need estrogen to grow. This study is evaluating how effective trastuzumab deruxtecan is at treating hormone receptor positive cancer cells that have low levels of HER2 expressed on them when given alone or in combination with anastrozole.",

The study will be done in three phases, described below.\n\nPhase 1a (Dose Escalation Phase):\n\nThe Phase 1a portion is designed to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of orally administered BTX-A51. BTX-A51 will be administered once daily on a weekly schedule of 5 days on/2 days off. Dose escalation will proceed according to a modified 3+3 design. Each cycle will consist of 28 days (4 weeks), and the DLT observation period will be the first cycle (i.e., 28 days after initiation of dosing). A DLT may be observed in no more than 0 out of 3 or 1 out of 6 subjects who have completed the DLT observation period before the next cohort initiates accrual. Barring DLT, sequential dose escalation of BTX-A51 is planned with up to a total of 6 dose levels; on the basis of these an MTD will be identified. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level with a subject incidence of DLTs of 0 or 1 out of 6 during the first 28 days of study drug dosing. A minimum of 6 subjects needs to be treated at a dose level before this dose level can be deemed as the MTD.\n\nPhase 1b (Monotherapy Dose Ranging Phase):\n\nDose expansion may begin when the RP2D has been determined. Up to 40 additional subjects at each of the 2 dose levels will be enrolled to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of BTX-A51 in subjects with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-), GATA3 mutant (mt) and wild-type (wt) metastatic breast cancer (mBC).

      "summary": "The purpose of this study is to learn whether it is safe to give HER2-CAR T cells in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug (pembrolizumab or nivolumab), to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with sarcoma.\n\nAnother goal of this study is to study the bacteria found in the stool of patients with sarcoma who are being treated with HER2 CAR T cells and immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs to see if the types of bacteria influence how well the treatment works.\n\nThe investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. They now want to see if they can put a new gene in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells. The new gene that the investigators will put in makes an antibody specific for HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) that binds to sarcoma cells. In addition, it contains CD28, which stimulated T cells and make them last longer. After this new gene is put into the T cell, the T cell becomes known as a chimeric antigen receptor T cell or CAR T cell.\n\nIn another clinical study using these CAR T cells targeting HER2 as well as other studies using CAR T cells, investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the effect the T cells can have. Giving chemotherapy before a T cell infusion is called lymphodepletion since the chemotherapy is specifically chosen to decrease the number of lymphocytes in the body. Decreasing the number of the patient's lymphocytes first should allow the infused T cells to expand in the body, and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively.\n\nThe chemotherapy used for lymphodepletion is a combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.\n\nAfter the patient receives the lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR T cells during treatment on the study, they will receive an antibody drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab or nivolumab. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are drugs that remove the brakes on the immune system to allow it to act against cancer.",

      "summary": "Gallbladder adenocarcinoma is a devastating disease associated with a poor prognosis. Gallbladder and other biliary cancers will be responsible for an estimated 11,980 new cases, and 4,090 deaths in the US during 2020. The 5-year survival for all patients with gallbladder cancer is 18%, however this plummets to 2% for patients with metastatic disease. Patients with gallbladder cancer frequently develop peritoneal recurrence, particularly after intra-operative bile spillage during cholecystectomy for incidentally discovered gallbladder malignancy. Once developed, peritoneal metastases are difficult to treat and result in significant morbidity and mortality. As a result, novel approaches that target peritoneal metastases are needed for this disease. Prophylactic use of heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been explored or is under active investigation for numerous gastrointestinal malignancies, including colon, gastric, and appendiceal cancers. HIPEC has efficacy in gallbladder cancer patients with macroscopic peritoneal disease undergoing cytoreductive surgery (CRS)/HIPEC and has been associated with a survival advantage in a multi-institutional retrospective case series. Incidentally discovered gallbladder cancer is treated with central hepatectomy and portal lymphadenectomy, therefore a prophylactic HIPEC can be easily incorporated into the second operation performed as part of the standard of care. In this early phase clinical trial, the investigators will explore the safety and feasibility of prophylactic HIPEC for gallbladder cancer in patients at high-risk of peritoneal recurrence.

Ongoing monthly GNRH agonist is required in pre-menopausal women or male participants for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry. If men or pre-menopausal women have not received regular GNRH agonist for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry, these patients will be excluded.\n* Participants must have radiological or objective evidence of progression on any CDK 4/6 inhibitor-containing regimen in the metastatic setting, and/or relapse/progression during or within 12 months of completion of any CDK4/6 inhibitor-containing regimen in the adjuvant setting.\n\n  * It is not mandatory to have a CDK4/6 inhibitor-containing regimen as the most recent treatment.\n* Participants must have radiological or objective evidence of progression on fulvestrant (as a single agent or as a component of any multi-drug regimen) in the metastatic setting.\n\n  * It is not mandatory to have a fulvestrant-containing regimen as the most recent treatment.\n* Prior therapy:\n\n  * No more than two prior chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting.\n  * For both the phase I and phase II portions of this trial, there is no limit on prior lines of endocrine therapy in the adjuvant or metastatic setting.\n* For phase 2 cohort only: Willing to undergo pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies. Patients are exempt from this requirement if, in the opinion of the investigator, the biopsy procedure would pose a significant risk. Biopsies are optional in the phase 1 cohort.\n* ECOG performance status \\<2.\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.5 x 109/L\n  * platelets \u2265100,000/\u03bcl\n  * hemoglobin \u22659 g/dL (If red blood cell transfusion has been administered, hemoglobin must remain stable and \u22659 g/dL without further transfusion for at least 1 week prior to first dose of study therapy).\n  * total bilirubin \u22641.5mg/dL (\u22643.0mg/dL in patients with known Gilbert syndrome and direct bilirubin within normal limits)\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u22642.5 \u00d7 institutional ULN.\n  * Adequate renal function with a creatinine clearance rate of \u2265 50 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula.\n  * International normalized ratio (INR) \u2264 1.5 and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \u2264 1.5 x ULN in the absence of anticoagulation or therapeutic levels in the presence of anticoagulation.\n  * Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) \u2264 2.5 x ULN.\n  * Adequate cardiac function with left ventricular ejection fraction \u2265 50% by echocardiography (ECHO) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan.\n  * Baseline QTc interval \\< 480 ms (average of triplicate readings) using Fredericia's QT correction formula. NOTE: This criterion does not apply to patients with a complete or incomplete right or left bundle branch block.\n* Adequate recovery from toxicities related to prior systemic treatments, surgery, or radiotherapy to at least Grade 1 by CTCAE v 5.0. Exceptions include alopecia and peripheral neuropathy grade \u2264 2.\n* Age \\>18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of study agents in participants \\<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.\n* Women of childbearing potential, women who are made postmenopausal through use of GNRH agonists, and men must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of protocol treatment. Women meeting these criteria will need to use adequate contraception for at least 30 days after the last dose of abemaciclib or VS-6766 and for one year after the last dose of fulvestrant. Men will need to use adequate contraception for 90 days after the last dose of abemaciclib or VS-6766 and for one year after the last dose of fulvestrant. Additionally, males must agree not to donate sperm for the duration of protocol treatment and for at least 90 days after the last dose of protocol therapy. Childbearing potential for this purpose is defined as: those who have not been surgically sterilized and/or have had a menstrual period in the past 12 months. Adequate contraception is defined as one highly effective non-hormonal form of contraception or two effective forms of non-hormonal contraception by the participant and/or partner:\n\nHighly Effective Non-Hormonal Contraception Methods of birth control which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly are considered highly-effective forms of contraception.\n\nThe following non-hormonal methods of contraception are acceptable:\n\n* True abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. \\[Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\\].\n* Male sterilization (with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female participants, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner. OR Effective Non-Hormonal Contraception\n\nAlternatively two of the following effective forms of contraception may be used instead:\n\n* Placement of non-hormonal or progesterone-coated intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). Consideration should be given to the type of device being used, as there are higher failure rates quoted for certain types, e.g., steel or copper wire.\n* Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.\n* Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.\n* The use of barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of spermicide. The following should be noted:\n* Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not highly effective forms of contraception. Therefore, the use of additional spermicides does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.\n* However, spermicides alone are ineffective at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spilled. Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be used alone.\n\nIt should be noted that two forms of effective contraception are required. A double barrier method is acceptable, which is defined as condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.\n\n* A female of childbearing potential, as defined above in section 3.1.12, must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days of C1D1. A positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum test. Pregnancy testing does not need to be pursued in female participants who are:\n\n  * Age \\>60 years; or\n  * Age \\<60 years with intact uterus and amenorrhea for 12 consecutive months or more AND estrogen (estradiol) levels within postmenopausal range; or\n  * Status post bilateral oophorectomy, total hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation\n* Participant must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants with active brain metastases or with known carcinomatous meningitis. Stable, treated brain metastases are allowed (this includes participants who have documented radiologic stability at least 4 weeks after radiotherapy, and do not require systemic steroids for management of symptoms from CNS metastatic lesions). Any patients with documented brain metastasis not meeting above criteria for stable treated brain metastasis are considered to have active brain metastases.\n* Phase I: Participants who have discontinued prior abemaciclib for toxicity, at any dose. Phase II: Participants who have discontinued prior abemaciclib for toxicity, if that toxicity occurred at or above the RP2 dose level for abemaciclib that is incorporated into phase II of this trial.\n* Participants who have discontinued prior fulvestrant for toxicity.\n* Prior treatment with any MEK inhibitor.\n* The subject has received another investigational agent within at least 30 days or 5 half-lives of the first dose of study drug, whichever is longer, or is currently enrolled in any medical device research or other research that is judged by the sponsor to not be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.\n* The subject has received a chemotherapy agent or immunotherapy within 21 days of the first dose of study drug.\n* The subject has received an endocrine or biologic agent within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.\n* The subject has completed radiation within 14 days of registration. Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the acute effects of radiotherapy.\n* The subject has had major surgery within 14 days of registration.\n* Participants with the following pre-existing ocular pathology are excluded:\n* Patients with history of glaucoma, history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), predisposing factors for RVO, including uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes.\n* Patient with history of retinal pathology or evidence of visible retinal pathology that is considered a risk factor for RVO, intraocular pressure \\> 21 mm Hg as measured by tonometry, or other significant ocular pathology, such as anatomical abnormalities that increase the risk for RVO.\n* Patients with a history of corneal erosion (instability of corneal epithelium), corneal degeneration, active or recurrent keratitis, and other forms of serious ocular surface inflammatory conditions.\n* History of rhabdomyolysis or neuromuscular disorders that are associated with elevated CK (eg inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy).\n* The patient has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV), active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous six months, syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, severe obstructive pulmonary disease, or severe chronic liver or renal disease, or sudden cardiac arrest.\n* Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are potentially eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years and there is no evidence of disease recurrence for 1 year or more since completion of appropriate therapy: cervical cancer in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Patients with other cancers diagnosed within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed with the overall study PI to determine eligibility.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to VS-6766 (including inactive ingredients mannitol, magnesium stearate, HPMC (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) shells), abemaciclib, or fulvestrant.\n* Known history of testing positive for HIV with history of an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within the past 12 months, or need to receive combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.\n* Known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive). Screening is not required for enrollment. Patients with chronic HBV infection who meet criteria for anti-HBV therapy should be on suppressive antiviral therapy prior to initiation of study therapy. Patients with a history of HCV infection will need to have completed curative antiviral treatment with HCV viral load below the limit of quantification. Patients with untreated HCV may be enrolled if the HCV is stable and if the patient is not at risk for hepatic decompensation. Patients that need to receive antiviral therapy for HBV or HCV that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers will be excluded.\n* Patients exposed to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drugs (see Appendix C). Concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (see Appendix C), such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, or inducers (see Appendix C), such as St. John's wort, should be avoided during the study treatment.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because effect of combination VS-766, abemaciclib, and fulvestrant on a developing fetus is unknown. Breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to entry onto the study.\n* Patients with the inability to swallow oral medications, impaired gastrointestinal absorption due to gastrectomy or other major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, or other medical issue that would impact absorption of oral medication in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Patients with active systemic bacterial infection (requiring intravenous \\[IV\\] antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment), or fungal infection (requiring IV antifungal treatment at time of initiating study treatment), or severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection \u226428 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Patients on treatment with warfarin. Individuals on treatment with warfarin must be transitioned to anticoagulation instead with low-molecular-weight heparin or a direct oral anticoagulant prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Any other serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) (e.g. interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, other cardiac, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, psychiatric, neurological, or genetic conditions, etc.) that in the opinion of the Investigator would place the patient at unacceptably high risk for toxicity and therefore preclude participation in this study.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the addition of an immunotherapy drug (durvalumab) to usual chemotherapy versus usual chemotherapy alone in treating patients with MammaPrint High 2 Risk (MP2) stage II-III hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. There is some evidence from previous clinical trials that people who have a MammaPrint High 2 Risk result may be more likely to respond to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Adding durvalumab to usual chemotherapy may be able to prevent the cancer from returning for patients with MP2 stage II-III hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.",

      "summary": "This clinical trial is studying advanced solid tumors. Solid tumors are cancers that start in a part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once tumors have grown bigger in one place but haven't spread, they're called locally advanced. If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body, it's called metastatic. When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.\n\nParticipants in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment. Participants must have a solid tumor cancer that can't be treated with standard of care drugs.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called PF-08046050. PF-08046050 is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.\n\nThis study will test the safety of PF-08046050 in participants with solid tumors that are hard to treat or have spread throughout the body.\n\nThis study has 5 different study parts. Part A and Part B of the study will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if PF-08046050 is safe and if it works to treat certain solid tumor cancers. Part D and E of the study, together with information from Parts A and B, will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Part E will use the information from Parts A, B, and D to see if PF-08046050 is safe in combination with other anti-cancer agents and if it works to treat a certain solid tumor.",

Antibodies are proteins which are naturally produced by the body's immune system to help fight infections. ARX788 consists of antibodies that have been attached to a toxin that has the potential to kill cancer cells. ARX788 sticks to a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), which is found on some breast cancer cells. Giving ARX788 may be safe and effective in treating patients with HER2-low locally advanced unresectable metastatic breast cancer.",

Capecitabine is in a class of medications called antimetabolites. It is taken up by tumor cells and breaks down into fluorouracil, a substance that kills tumor cells. Adaptive therapy with capecitabine based on tumor burden response may slow or stop the growth of tumor cells in patients with metastatic ER positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.",

These types of treatment can cause scarring. Photodynamic therapy uses light along with a drug applied to the skin to kill the cancer cells and cause them to break apart. The light used can cause the skin to feel warm, but does not cause scarring.",

The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events and change in disease activity when telisotuzumab adizutecan (ABBV-400) is given in combination with Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and a programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD1) inhibitor Budigalimab. The combination (AFLB) will be given to adult participants to treat locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal adenocarcinoma (mGEA).\n\nTelisotuzumab Adizutecan (ABBV-400) and Budigalimab are investigational drugs being developed for the treatment of mGEA. Fluorouracil and Leucovorin are drugs approved for the treatment of mGEA. This study will be divided into two stages, with the first stage treating participants with increasing doses of ABBV-400 within the AFLB regimen until the dose reached is tolerable and expected to be efficacious. Participants will then be randomized into groups called treatment arms where one group will receive Budigalimab and FOLFOX (Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Oxaliplatin) . A further two treatment groups will receive AFLB, but with two optimized doses of ABBV-400 to allow for the best dose to be studied in the future. Approximately 180 adult participants with mGEA will be enrolled in the study in 51 sites worldwide.\n\nIn the dose escalation stage, participants will be treated with increasing intravenous (IV) doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan (ABBV-400) within the AFLB regimen until the dose reached is tolerable and expected to be efficacious. In the dose optimization stage, participants will receive FOLFOX or receive AFLB, but with one of two optimized doses of ABBV-400. The study will run for a duration of approximately 6 years.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side effects.",
