      "summary": "Background:\n\nThe NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. Researchers want to know if TIL shrink s tumors in people with digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial cancers. In this study, we are selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can cause digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Adults age 18-72 with upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, breast, ovarian/endometrial cancer, or glioblastoma refractory to standard chemotherapy.\n\nDesign:\n\nWork up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed.\n\nSurgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.\n\nLeukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. (Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.)\n\nTreatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.\n\nFollow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.",

      "summary": "Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is a type of cancer that can damage tissue or cause lesions to form in one or more places in the body. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a cancer that begins in LCH cells (a type of dendritic cell which fights infection). Sometimes there are mutations (changes) in LCH cells as they form. These include mutations of the BRAF gene. These changes may make the LCH cells grow and multiply quickly. This causes LCH cells to build up in certain parts of the body, where they can damage tissue or form lesions.\n\nFor most patients with LCH, standard-of-care vinblastine/prednisone are used as front-line therapy while cytarabine therapy has been used as therapy for patients who develop recurrence. No alternate treatment strategy has been developed for frontline therapy in LCH.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to compare previously used vinblastine/prednisone to single therapy with cytarabine for LCH. We will evaluate the utility of an imaging study called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to more accurately assess areas of LCH involvement not otherwise seen in other imaging studies as well as response to therapy. We also want to identify if genetic and other biomarkers (special proteins in patient's blood and in patient's cancer) relate to the response of patients LCH to study treatment.",

If archival tumor material is exhausted, then a new fresh tumor biopsy that is formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) must be obtained. Patients who need the fresh biopsy must also submit whole peripheral blood for ctDNA testing. A tumor block or FFPE slides 4-5 microns thick must be submitted. Bone biopsies are not allowed. If FFPE slides are to be submitted, at least 12 unstained slides plus an H\\&E stained slide, or 13 unstained slides must be submitted. However, it is strongly recommended that 20 FFPE slides be submitted. Note: Previous next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) will be repeated if done outside this study for sub-study assignment.\n\n   Patients must agree to have any tissue that remains after testing retained for the use of sub-study Translational Medicine (TM) studies at the time of consent the patient is enrolled in.\n5.

Selumetinib works by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may kill tumor cells. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Vincristine is in a class of medications called vinca alkaloids. It works by stopping tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. The overall goal of this study is to see if selumetinib works just as well as the standard treatment of CV for patients with LGG. Another goal of this study is to compare the effects of selumetinib versus CV in subjects with LGG to find out which is better. Additionally, this trial will also examine if treatment with selumetinib improves the quality of life for subjects who take it.",

      "summary": "This collaborative screening protocol, developed by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) and supported by the Thoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG), is designed to determine the feasibility of comprehensive molecular profiling to detect actionable oncogenic drivers in patients with suspected early stage lung cancers scheduled to undergo biopsies to establish the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\nThe primary purpose of this testing is to determine the presence of 12 oncogenic drivers (mutations in EGFR, BRAFV600E , MET exon 14, KRAS G12C and HER2, rearrangements in ALK, RET, NTRK, EGFR exon 20 insertion and ROS1, and amplification of MET and HER2) that can serve as targets making patients eligible for upcoming targeted neoadjuvant therapy trials. The ultimate goal is to use this information from the screening process to select the optimal neoadjuvant therapy and wherever possible enroll patients onto separate neoadjuvant therapy trials with genomically matched treatments or other appropriate trials if no actionable driver mutation is detected.\n\nThoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG) is a network of surgeons within North American Thoracic Surgery Academic Centers aligned with the goal of enhancing patient care through administration of multi-site trials focused on recent advances in lung cancer. TSOG has aligned with the LCMC4 sites to enroll the LCRF-LEADER screening trial. TSOG's involvement will be essential in trial enrollment and ultimate interpretation of the multimodal clinical and translational data collected as part of this study. We estimate we will detect an actionable oncogenic driver in 33% of cases. The remaining 66% of patients will represent a cohort identified by their care teams as candidates for other potential neoadjuvant therapies which may include checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab or other novel agents.\n\nThe targeted therapy treatment trials will be conducted independently of the LCRF-LEADER screening trial, evaluating for efficacy. If none of the 10 oncogenic drivers are detected, the patient will be offered participation in any clinical trial of neoadjuvant therapy available at their treating institution or standard of care therapy. For patients not enrolled on a targeted treatment trial, circulating tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA) will be collected at 3 time points: before neoadjuvant treatment, after neoadjuvant treatment but before surgery, and after surgery. This initiative will be correlated with various clinical outcomes. Prespecified clinical data will be collected for correlation with these circulating biomarkers.",

      "summary": "This phase 1/2 trial will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 (Dose Selection) is designed to find the dose of dapansutrile with acceptable tolerability in combination with pembrolizumab. Part 1 will consist of up to 2 dose selection cohorts to evaluate the safety and tolerability of dapansutrile + pembrolizumab in patients with PD-1 resistant melanoma to find the recommended part 2 dose (RP2D). Part 1 will include a lead-in phase of dapansutrile monotherapy at 500 mg PO BID. At day 15, combination therapy with pembrolizumab will be initiated. Dose escalation is planned to a maximum of 1000 mg BID of dapansutrile + pembrolizumab.\n\nPart 2 (Dose Expansion) is designed to assess preliminary efficacy of dapansutrile + pembrolizumab in PD-1 resistant melanoma. Once all patients in Part 1 have completed 4 weeks of dapansutrile therapy, the expansion phase will start enrolling. Part 2 will also include a 14-day lead-in period of dapansutrile monotherapy at the RP2D.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial determines if the combination of ONC201 with different drugs is effective for treating participants with diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs). Despite years of research, little to no progress has been made to improve outcomes for participants with DMGs, and there are few treatment options. This trial will utilize an adaptive platform design in that the different treatment arms for each cohort will be opened and closed based on ongoing preclinical investigation as well as evolving outcome data from the trial.\n\nNovel agents will be continuously added to this study as pre-clinical data emerge to suggest additive or synergistic activity when combined ONC201. Should a novel agent not have an RP2D at the time of incorporation into this study, a phase 1 lead-in will be performed prior to initiation of combination therapy (via study amendment).",

      "summary": "The purpose of this phase 1 clinical trials is to determine whether niraparib (a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi)) can be safely combined with irinotecan with manageable toxicity and reasonable efficacy. Emerging evidence suggest that PARPi is an effective therapeutic strategy in a wider subset of solid tumors that may have defective homologous recombination (HR) or DNA repair gene mutations. BReast CAncer gene (BRCA), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), and various other DNA repair germline mutations predispose carriers to cancers of the breast, ovaries, pancreas, prostate and melanoma. A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated that PARP inhibitors can work as chemopotentiators. There is significant interest in this combination, and the recommended phase II dose will be used in the upcoming NCI ComboMatch trial.",

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a type of disease that occurs when the body makes too many immature Langerhans cells (a type of white blood cell). When these cells build up, they can form tumors in certain tissues and organs including bones, skin, lungs and pituitary gland and can damage them. This tumor is more common in children and young adults. DAY101 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Using DAY101 may be effective in treating patients with relapsed or refractory Langerhans cell histiocytosis.",

The study team is also trying to find out the side effects of this type of surgery and how much the surgery impacts quality of life.\n\nIn order to be eligible for this study, participants must have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma and have one detected cancerous lymph node by imaging (CT/PET scan) or clinical examination, and are a candidate for lymph node excision.",

        "raw_text": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form.\n2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study.\n3. Male or female, aged 18 years or older at enrollment\n4. ECOG performance status of 0-2\n5. Subjects must have histologically (or cytologically) confirmed metastatic melanoma to only one lymph node in the axilla, groin, or iliac basin that was detected clinically. A clinically positive lymph node is defined as a palpable and clinically suspicious node (based on palpation or imaging), or non-palpable lymph node that is FDG-avid or \u2265 0.95 cm on PET-CT, based on professional assessment of the radiologist, and that also is confirmed to contain metastatic melanoma on biopsy.\n\n   a) The clinically positive lymph node may have been removed within 8 weeks prior to enrollment, and in that case may or may not have been evaluated by PET-CT; it is considered a clinically positive node if it was either identified as clinically suspicious on exam and/or on preoperative scans based on FDG-avidity and/or diameter \u2265 0.95 cm, and also confirmed histologically. The clinically positive node must be within the primary draining node basin of the primary melanoma, or the metastasis may be from an unknown primary site. A node that was removed at sentinel node biopsy will not meet this eligibility criterion. A patient will not be eligible if there is evidence of an additional clinically positive node on imaging or physical exam after excision of the first clinically positive node.\n6. Subjects must be able to undergo LNEx and must not be on a clinical trial that requires TLND.\n\n   a. Subjects may have previously had metastatic melanoma to a sentinel node in the same node basin, if complete lymph node dissection was not done, and if at least 1 year has elapsed since the prior positive sentinel node biopsy.\n7. Individuals will be required to have radiological studies to rule out radiologically evident melanoma metastasis. Required studies include:\n\n   * PET-CT scan, and\n   * Head CT scan or MRI These scans may have been performed prior to resection of the primary melanoma and/or sentinel node biopsy if they showed no evidence of other metastases.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subjects who have had a prior complete lymph node dissection or radiation therapy of the clinically positive node basin.\n2. Subjects who have, or have had, in-transit or satellite metastases from the same primary melanoma that has metastasized to the cLN that is the focus of the current study.\n\n   a. The only exception are subjects who have had in-transit or satellite metastases without intervening recurrence within the year prior to the subject's enrollment on the study.\n3. Subjects who have, or have had, one or more metastases distant to the primary draining lymph node basin. An individual with small radiologic or clinical findings of an indeterminate nature may still be eligible: examples include a new 5 mm lung nodule that is too small to characterize or an asymptomatic 12 mm bony lucency that is not classic for malignancy, where clinical care may otherwise be to follow the patient with repeat imaging rather than to treat the lesion.\n4. Subjects with pre-existing lymphedema that precludes assessment of lymphedema. Pre-existing lymphedema should be discussed with the principal investigator (PI) at the treating institution or the overall study PI. Some patients with mild stable lymphedema at the time of enrollment may still be evaluable. The primary endpoint for lymphedema measurement is the circumference 10 cm proximal to ankle/wrist on the involved side vs the contralateral side. If there is a pre-existing difference, then it will be important to be able to assess for meaningful increases after surgery.\n5. Subjects whose treating physician(s) plan adjuvant radiation therapy to the involved node basin, because that also would confound assessment of node basin recurrence and lymphedema.\n6. Individuals for whom there is a medical contraindication or potential problem in complying with the requirements of the protocol in the opinion of the investigator.\n7. Subjects with a prior or concurrent malignancy may be eligible if its natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the regimen.\n8. Subjects who are receiving systemic or intratumoral therapy for this melanoma within 3 months of enrollment. They may have received prior adjuvant systemic therapy for an earlier stage of disease, but should be off that therapy for 3 months prior to enrollment.\n\n   1. The only exception is for patients who are being treated at a participating center with neoadjuvant therapy for 1 cLN, and who otherwise meet criteria for enrollment. They should be screened and enrolled as soon as possible. The intent of this exception is to allow enrollment of patients who are being evaluated at that center before the study is open but whose LN Excision date can occur after the study is open to enrollment, or for patients who are not able to make a decision about enrollment on this study prior to starting neoadjuvant therapy. For such patients, data collected prior to starting neoadjuvant therapy should be recorded as screening data (such as imaging studies), but baseline lymphedema measurements, FACT-M and WPAI surveys, and anything else not done prior to starting neoadjuvant therapy should be performed as soon as possible, and prior to LN Excision. This exception does reduce the power to address some exploratory endpoints; so, use of this exception should be minimized as much as possible.",

Immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Sirolimus and prednisone are immunosuppressants that are given to keep the body from rejecting the transplanted kidney.

        "raw_text": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must be kidney transplant recipients with a functioning allograft who do not currently require dialysis\n* Patient's age must be \\>= 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event (AE) data are currently available on the use of nivolumab and ipilimumab in kidney transplant recipients \\<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future pediatric trials\n* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed non-uveal melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma for which standard non-immunological medical, surgical, or radiation therapy would be insufficient (i.e., patients who are not surgical candidates). Patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or Merkel cell carcinoma may enroll without prior medical therapy (e.g., cetuximab or chemotherapy respectively). Non-immunologic standard therapies that patients must have received, refused or for which patients were ineligible include:\n\n  * For patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, prior therapies include BRAF/MEK inhibitors\n  * For patients with Basal cell carcinoma, prior therapies include hedgehog pathway inhibitors\n* Patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, i.e., at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as \\>= 20 mm by chest x-ray or as \\>= 10 mm with CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam is preferred, but not required\n* Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =\\< 2 (Karnofsky \\>= 60%) performance status criteria\n* Leukocytes \\>= 2,000/mcL\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\>= 1,500/mcL\n* Platelets \\>= 50,000/mcL\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) =\\< 2.5 x institutional ULN\n* Serum creatinine =\\< 3 x ULN\n* dd-cfDNA =\\< 1.0% and =\\< 61% increase\n* The effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) receiving nivolumab must continue contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception.\n\nWOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin \\[B-HCG\\]) during the screening period. Follow-up evaluations will include interval sexual/menstrual histories as needed.\n\nShould a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) should inform the treating physician immediately.\n\nWOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. Women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL to be considered postmenopausal.\n\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients will be eligible for this trial if they are on effective antiretroviral regimens utilizing non-CYP-interactive agents and have an undetectable viral load. If there is evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated. If there is history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the patient must have been treated and have undetectable HCV viral load.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Legally authorized representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have received a liver, lung, heart, or pancreas transplant; or allogeneic stem cell transplant; or any kind of bone marrow transplant\n* Patients unwilling or unable to undergo dialysis in the event of allograft failure\n* Patients with prior evidence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or non-HLA donor-specific antibodies (DSA)\n* Patients with a history of antibody- or cell-mediated allograft rejection within 3 months of study entry\n* Potential trial participants should have recovered from clinically significant adverse events of their most recent therapy/intervention prior to enrollment\n* Patients may have received prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy; however, patients must not have any other checkpoint antibody targeting T-cell co-stimulation within 1 year of study enrollment. Prior history of adjuvant therapy is allowed if received over 1 year prior to enrollment. Prior receipt of oncolytic therapy (e.g., TVEC, RP1) is allowed\n* Patients must not be receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients with leptomeningeal metastases, more than 3 untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases, untreated brain metastases measuring \\>1cm, or requiring treatment-dose steroids (\\> 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for CNS-related symptoms. Exclusions are due to concerns regarding progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other AEs. Patients with brain metastases meeting the above requirements are permitted to enroll\n* Patients must not have a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody\n* Patients must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to other agents used in the study\n* Patients must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or any other significant condition(s) that would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab and ipilimumab have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab or ipilimumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Patients with autoimmune disease that is active or might recur and affect vital organ function will be eligible only after consultation with the study PI. Guillain-Barre (GB) syndrome, bullous skin disease, Stevens Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis will be excluded\n* Patients must not have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, GI obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need for additional treatment before coming on study. In addition, patients with a history of cardiac disease including coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, heart block, should have an evaluation by history pulmonary embolism (PE) and appropriate testing to allow evaluation of any events that may occur on study. These may include troponin, electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (ECHO) as clinically indicated and may include results already in the medical record if available",

      "summary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, best dose, and effectiveness of ZEN003694 in combination with cetuximab and encorafenib in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory), that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed), and that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). ZEN003694 is a protein inhibitor that binds to BET proteins. When ZEN003694 binds to BET proteins, it disrupts gene expression. Preventing the expression of certain growth-promoting genes may inhibit proliferation of tumor cells that over-express BET proteins. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Encorafenib is an enzyme inhibitor. It inhibits pathways that are responsible for controlling cell proliferation and survival, which may lead to a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. Both cetuximab and encorafenib have been approved to treat cancer. Adding ZEN003694 to cetuximab and encorafenib may be more effective at treating patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer than giving the usual treatment (cetuximab and encorafenib) alone.",

Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694. As proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 receptor antagonists, and antacids may alter the pharmacokinetics of ZEN003694 by reducing ZEN003694 exposure, patients receiving proton pump inhibitors are ineligible. If H2 blockers or other acid reducing agents are used concomitantly with ZEN003694, a staggered dosing schedule should be used, either dose ZEN003694 2 hours before the H2 blocker or 10-12 hours after an H2 blocker. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZEN003694 is BRD and BET inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ZEN003694, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ZEN003694.

      "summary": "This clinical trial tests whether atorvastatin prevents metastasis of resected high-risk stage IIA, IIB or IIIA melanoma. The vast majority of melanomas are diagnosed at an early, localized stage. However, approximately 10-15% of these localized melanomas will eventually metastasize, despite appropriate local treatment. Once metastasis occurs, median survival is less than two years. Melanomas at high risk of metastasis can be identified by gene expression profiling. Statin drugs, like atorvastatin, have been used to treat high cholesterol for the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events, but not for preventing melanoma metastasis. Statins could prevent melanoma metastasis through decreasing tumor cell migration, decreasing tumor cell adhesion, and increasing immune system response. Statins are also efficient inhibitors of new lymphatic vessels formation. Since tumor lymphatic vessels serve as highways to lymph nodes and may suppress immune system responses, statins may block a critical step towards melanoma metastasis. Using atorvastatin may have the potential to prevent metastasis and improve outcomes in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.",

Vemurafenib and cobimetinib are used in patients whose cancer has a mutated (changed) form of a gene called BRAF. They are in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. They work by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Giving vemurafenib and cobimetinib may work better to treat patients with high risk differentiated thyroid carcinoma with BRAFV600E mutation, in preparation for radioactive iodine therapy.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of cabozantinib versus combination dabrafenib and trametinib for the treatment of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer that does not respond to treatment (refractory) and which expresses a BRAF V600E mutation. Cabozantinib is in a class of medications called receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It binds to and blocks the action of several enzymes which are often over-expressed in a variety of tumor cell types. This may help stop or slow the growth of tumor cells and blood vessels the tumor needs to survive. Dabrafenib is an enzyme inhibitor that binds to and inhibits the activity of a protein called B-raf, which may inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells which contain a mutated BRAF gene. Trametinib is also an enzyme inhibitor. It binds to and inhibits the activity of proteins called MEK 1 and 2, which play a key role in activating pathways that regulate cell growth. This may inhibit the growth of tumor cells mediated by these pathways. The usual approach for patients with thyroid cancer is targeted therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib. This trial may help researchers decide which treatment option (cabozantinib alone or dabrafenib in combination with trametinib) is safer and/or more effective in treating patients with refractory BRAF V600E-mutated differentiated thyroid cancer.",

      "summary": "Pediatric gliomas harboring BRAF-alterations, commonly BRAFV600 mutation or KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, are currently treated with either chemotherapy or mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, such as, dabrafenib and/or trametinib. Unfortunately, some BRAF-altered gliomas can progress or have rebound growth after discontinuation of therapy. Data from BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma has shown potential synergy between MAPK inhibition and anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD1) checkpoint blockade. Anti-PD1 therapy, such as, nivolumab can block the PD1 receptor on T cells, a marker of T cell exhaustion, allowing a continued or more robust anti-tumor immune response. Here, investigators will combine MAPK inhibition with anti-PD1 therapy in recurrent, refractory low grade BRAF-altered glioma and newly diagnosed or recurrent BRAF-altered or NF-altered high grade glioma.",

With this rapid shift in treatment, significant gaps in knowledge exist regarding the impact of ICIs on patients' symptom experiences. An in-depth characterization of inter-individual differences in patients' symptom experiences will fill this knowledge gap and assist with the early detection of ICI toxicity; guide symptom management; inform treatment decision making; and refine ICI-symptom instrument development.
