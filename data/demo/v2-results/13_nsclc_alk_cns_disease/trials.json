NK cells, white blood cells important to the immune system, are donated/collected from cord blood collected at birth from healthy babies and grown in the lab. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving NK cells together with cyclophosphamide and etoposide may work better in treating children and young adults with solid tumors.",

For patients treated with consolidation anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy for Stage III disease, disease progression on consolidation anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy must have occurred within one year from the date or initiation of such therapy.\n      * For patients whose prior therapy was for Stage IV or recurrent disease, the patient must have received at least one line of a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, alone or in combination (e.g. Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab).\n   2. Pre-Screening prior to progression on current treatment:\n\n   To be eligible for pre-screening, current treatment must be for Stage IV or recurrent disease and patient must have received at least one dose of the current regimen. Patients must have previously received or currently be receiving a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, alone or in combination (e.g. Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab).

If archival tumor material is exhausted, then a new fresh tumor biopsy that is formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) must be obtained. Patients who need the fresh biopsy must also submit whole peripheral blood for ctDNA testing. A tumor block or FFPE slides 4-5 microns thick must be submitted. Bone biopsies are not allowed. If FFPE slides are to be submitted, at least 12 unstained slides plus an H\\&E stained slide, or 13 unstained slides must be submitted. However, it is strongly recommended that 20 FFPE slides be submitted. Note: Previous next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) will be repeated if done outside this study for sub-study assignment.\n\n   Patients must agree to have any tissue that remains after testing retained for the use of sub-study Translational Medicine (TM) studies at the time of consent the patient is enrolled in.\n5. Patients with known EGFR sensitizing mutations, EGFR T790M mutation, ALK gene fusion, ROS 1 gene rearrangement, or BRAF V600E mutation are not eligible unless they have progressed following all standard of care targeted therapy.

      "summary": "This collaborative screening protocol, developed by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) and supported by the Thoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG), is designed to determine the feasibility of comprehensive molecular profiling to detect actionable oncogenic drivers in patients with suspected early stage lung cancers scheduled to undergo biopsies to establish the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\nThe primary purpose of this testing is to determine the presence of 12 oncogenic drivers (mutations in EGFR, BRAFV600E , MET exon 14, KRAS G12C and HER2, rearrangements in ALK, RET, NTRK, EGFR exon 20 insertion and ROS1, and amplification of MET and HER2) that can serve as targets making patients eligible for upcoming targeted neoadjuvant therapy trials. The ultimate goal is to use this information from the screening process to select the optimal neoadjuvant therapy and wherever possible enroll patients onto separate neoadjuvant therapy trials with genomically matched treatments or other appropriate trials if no actionable driver mutation is detected.\n\nThoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG) is a network of surgeons within North American Thoracic Surgery Academic Centers aligned with the goal of enhancing patient care through administration of multi-site trials focused on recent advances in lung cancer. TSOG has aligned with the LCMC4 sites to enroll the LCRF-LEADER screening trial. TSOG's involvement will be essential in trial enrollment and ultimate interpretation of the multimodal clinical and translational data collected as part of this study. We estimate we will detect an actionable oncogenic driver in 33% of cases. The remaining 66% of patients will represent a cohort identified by their care teams as candidates for other potential neoadjuvant therapies which may include checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab or other novel agents.\n\nThe targeted therapy treatment trials will be conducted independently of the LCRF-LEADER screening trial, evaluating for efficacy. If none of the 10 oncogenic drivers are detected, the patient will be offered participation in any clinical trial of neoadjuvant therapy available at their treating institution or standard of care therapy. For patients not enrolled on a targeted treatment trial, circulating tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA) will be collected at 3 time points: before neoadjuvant treatment, after neoadjuvant treatment but before surgery, and after surgery. This initiative will be correlated with various clinical outcomes. Prespecified clinical data will be collected for correlation with these circulating biomarkers.",

      "summary": "This phase II/III trial compares the effect of immunotherapy with atezolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus standard therapy alone for the treatment of poorly differentiated extrapulmonary (originated outside the lung) neuroendocrine cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). The other aim of this trial is to compare using atezolizumab just at the beginning of treatment versus continuing it beyond the initial treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cisplatin and carboplatin are in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds that work by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill cancer cells. Giving atezolizumab in combination with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide may work better in treating patients with poorly differentiated extrapulmonary neuroendocrine cancer compared to standard therapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide alone.",

In Part A of the study, dose escalation is carried out where MTD is evaluated using Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design in subjects with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR-mutation of C797S or T790M. In Part B, dose exploration is carried out to further evaluate the safety of JIN-A02 and to determine the RP2D using 2 preliminary effective dose levels and with the help of a safety review committee (SRC) in advanced NSCLC subjects harboring EGFR mutant C797S or T790M. In Part C dose expansion study, subjects with EGFR mutant who show disease progression after receiving standard anticancer therapy, including approved EGFR-TKI therapy with activity against T790M such as Osimertinib and/or no more than one platinum-based anticancer chemotherapy, are divided into 5 different cohorts based on the EGFR mutation and the anti-tumor activity of JIN-A02 is evaluated. Before enrollment in the study, the EGFR mutant profile is determined using either tumor tissue and/or plasma ctDNA. The profile is determined locally through a test method approved by the sponsor. The sponsor reviews and approves each potential subject for enrollment. Study eligibility evaluation will utilize local test(s).",

Radiation therapy is a standard cancer treatment that uses high energy rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Split-course adaptive radiation therapy uses patient disease response to alter the intensity of the radiation therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, cemiplimab, atezolizumab or nivolumab may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs like carboplatin, pemetrexed, and paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving split-course adaptive radiation therapy with standard treatments like immunotherapy and chemotherapy may be more effective at treating stage IV or locally advanced lung cancer than giving them alone.",

We will train and test AI/ML models to predict 0-4 hour postprandial response curves for glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and GLP-1, to the standardized diet-specific meal test (DSMT) collected after each of the three different diets delivered in Module 2. Each diet functions as a controlled stimulus to reveal biological features (such as individual variables, patterns, or clusters of measurements) that best predict a person's response.\n\nThe Module 2 DSMT response curves are the primary outcomes (dependent variables) for AI/ML algorithms that predict individual responses to diet patterns.\n\nAs a secondary objective, NPH will evaluate the validity and acceptability of technology-based dietary assessment tools. The Automated Self-Administered 24-hour recall (ASA24), Automatic Ingestion Monitor-2 (AIM-2), and the mobile food record (mFR) will be evaluated in Modules 2 and 3, and the ASA24 food record and the image-assisted ASA24 recall will be evaluated only in Module 3. Total energy intake, macronutrient and dietary fiber intake data are the main outcomes for validity testing compared against measures of actual intake. Acceptability will be determined from feedback surveys.",

      "summary": "This clinical trial is studying advanced solid tumors. Solid tumors are cancers that start in a part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once tumors have grown bigger in one place but haven't spread, they're called locally advanced. If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body, it's called metastatic. When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.\n\nParticipants in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment. Participants must have a solid tumor cancer that can't be treated with standard of care drugs.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called PF-08046050. PF-08046050 is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.\n\nThis study will test the safety of PF-08046050 in participants with solid tumors that are hard to treat or have spread throughout the body.\n\nThis study has 5 different study parts. Part A and Part B of the study will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if PF-08046050 is safe and if it works to treat certain solid tumor cancers. Part D and E of the study, together with information from Parts A and B, will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Part E will use the information from Parts A, B, and D to see if PF-08046050 is safe in combination with other anti-cancer agents and if it works to treat a certain solid tumor.",

Compared to other racial/ethnic groups, AIANs have 6 times higher rates of developing smoking-related cancers, including lung cancer. Commercial cigarette smoking accounts for half of all deaths among AIANs nationwide. AIANs' often lack of access to smoking cessation interventions, which may be due to inequities in the healthcare system, lack of health insurance, living in rural areas, systemic racism, and historical trauma. There is also a lack of effective smoking cessation interventions for AIANs. Smartphone apps have the potential to deliver a low-cost smoking cessation intervention with wide reach to AIANs. Apps require no in-person delivery and no provider training, do not require integration into complex hospital systems, can be freely accessed on an app store, and are available at any time and any place. iCanQuit is a behavioral intervention designed to help adults stop smoking by teaching skills for coping with smoking urges, staying motivated, and preventing relapse. The iCanQuit app intervention may be more effective than the currently available NCI QuitGuide app at helping AIANs quit smoking.",

HER2 is a protein that helps cells to grow and divide. A damage (also called mutation) to the building plans (genes) for this protein in cancer cells leads to a production of abnormal HER2 and therefore abnormal cell growth and division.\n\nThe study treatment, BAY 2927088, is expected to block the mutated HER2 protein which may stop the spread of NSCLC.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn how well BAY 2927088 works and how safe it is compared with standard treatment, in participants who have advanced NSCLC with specific genetic changes called HER2 mutations.\n\nThe study participants will receive one of the study treatments:\n\n* BAY 2927088 twice every day as a tablet by mouth, or\n* Standard treatment in cycles of 21 days via infusion (\"drip\") into the vein. The treatment will continue for as long as participants benefit from it without any severe side effects or until they or their doctor decide to stop the treatment.\n\nDuring the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* take imaging scans, including CT, PET, MRI, and X-rays, of different parts of the body to study the spread of cancer\n* check the overall health of the participants by performing tests such as blood and urine tests, and checking\n* heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* perform pregnancy tests for women\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study.

      "summary": "Lung cancer is responsible for more deaths in the United States than breast, prostate and colon cancer combined and is the number one cancer killer of Veterans. This is because lung cancer is usually diagnosed when the disease has spread, and cure is less likely. Lung cancer screening (LCS) finds cancer at an earlier stage when it is curable, yet only 20% of eligible Veterans have been screened. Uptake is even lower among Black Veterans despite higher lung cancer risk. Using prediction models to identify high-benefit people for whom LCS should be encouraged improves efficiency and reduces disparities. Moreover, it is more patient-centered as shared decision-making conversations can be tailored with personalized information. The US Preventive Services Task Force has called for research to demonstrate that prediction-augmented LCS can be feasibly implemented at the point-of-care. The investigators propose for VA to lead this effort with a large-scale pragmatic clinical trial to show that prediction-augmented LCS is both feasible and improves LCS uptake.",

Is an adult \u226518 years of age or the minimum legal age (whichever is greater) at the time of informed consent. (Follow local regulatory requirements if the legal age of adult voluntary consent for trial participation is \\>18 years old).\n3. Has histologically documented NSCLC that meets all of the following criteria:\n\n   1. Has no prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease.\n   2. Has Stage IIIB or IIIC disease and is not a candidate for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or Stage IV NSCLC disease at the time of enrollment/randomization (based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer, Eighth Edition). Participants with early-stage NSCLC who have relapsed should be restaged during Screening to ensure their eligibility for the trial.\n   3. Has documented negative test results for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 actionable genomic alterations based on analysis of tumor tissue. If test results for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 are not available, participants are required to undergo testing performed locally for these genomic alterations.\n\n      Participants with squamous NSCLC are only required to undergo EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 testing if they have no history of tobacco smoking or were diagnosed with NSCLC at \\<40 years of age.\n   4. Has no known actionable genomic alterations in NTRK, BRAF, RET, MET, or other actionable oncogenic drivers with locally approved therapies (testing for genomic alterations besides EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 is not required prior to enrollment/randomization). Participants whose tumors harbor KRAS mutations are eligible for the trial.\n4. Has measurable disease on CT or MRI based on local imaging assessment using RECIST v1.1\n5. Has a tumor expressing PD-L1 TPS \u226550% as determined by local testing using 22C3 pharmDx PD-L1 IHC assay. In regions where PD-L1 (TPS \u226550%) testing by 22C3 pharmDx is not considered SOC, PD-L1 expression levels will be determined by central testing (minimum of 6 slides).\n6. Has provided a formalin-fixed tumor tissue sample for the assessment of biomarkers. This tissue requirement is in addition to the tissue required for PD-L1 testing for tissue screening purposes. If a documented law or regulation prohibits (or does not approve) sample collection, then such sample will not be collected.\n7. Has an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 at Screening.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria\n\n1. Has received prior treatment with any of the following, including in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting:\n\n   1. Any anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX40, or CD137).\n   2. Has previously been treated with any enhancer of zeste homolog inhibitors.\n2. Participants who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy other than those listed in the exclusion criterion above are eligible if the adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy was completed at least 6 months prior to the current diagnosis of advanced or metastatic disease.\n3. Has received a live vaccine or live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial intervention. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, and typhoid vaccines. Note: Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.\n4. Has an active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (ie, with use of systemic disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n\n   Inhaled, intranasal, intraocular, intra-articular, or topical steroids and adrenal replacement steroids are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n5. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (at doses exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial intervention. Note: Short-course systemic corticosteroids (eg, prevention of/treatment for transfusion reaction) or steroid use for a noncancer indication (eg, adrenal replacement) is permissible.\n6. Has a known active or untreated CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate, provided they are radiologically stable (ie, without evidence of progression) for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note: repeat imaging should be performed during trial screening), clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days before the first dose of trial intervention. Note: A CT scan or MRI scan of the brain at Baseline is required for all participants. For participants in whom CNS metastases are first discovered at Screening, the treating investigator should delay trial intervention to complete any necessary treatment followed by a proper washout period and document the stability of CNS metastases with repeat imaging at least 4 weeks later (in which case repetition of all screening activities may be required).\n7. Has uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including the following:\n\n   1. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula \\>470 ms (based on the average of screening triplicate 12-lead ECG determinations)\n   2. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Screening\n   3. Uncontrolled angina pectoris within 6 months prior to Screening\n   4. New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure\n   5. Uncontrolled hypertension (resting systolic blood pressure \\>160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\>100 mmHg)\n8. Has a history of (noninfectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at Screening.\n9. Has a history of radiation pneumonitis.\n10. Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests the safety and effectiveness of the combination of grid radiation therapy and standard of care (SOC) immunotherapy in treating patients with stage IV non-small lung cancer (NSCLC). Conventional radiation therapy treatments typically deliver the same radiation dose to the entire tumor. Spatially fractionated radiation therapy or grid therapy is approved and a technique which permits the delivery of high doses of radiation to small regions of the tumor which can lead to enhanced tumor cell killing. Grid therapy has been shown to produce dramatic relief of severe symptoms, significant tumor regression (decrease in the size of a tumor), and above average local control rates often exceeding those expected with conventionally delivered radiation treatments, all with minimal associated toxicity. Immunotherapy has become combined into treating patients, which has led improvements in survival and quality of life. Immunotherapy is now the cornerstone of SOC therapy for stage IV NSCLC. Grid radiation therapy combined with immunotherapy may be safe and effective in treating patients with stage IV NSCLC.",

      "summary": "This clinical trial compares the use of oral nicotine pouches to nicotine replacement therapy, consisting of nicotine patches and lozenges, to reduce cigarette use in smokers living in rural Appalachia. The lung and oral cancers that plague Appalachia are fueled by cigarette smoking. Oral nicotine pouches which contain nicotine but no tobacco leaf, present a new opportunity to reduce cancer risk among Appalachian adults who smoke. Oral nicotine pouches and nicotine replacement therapy may work well to reduce cigarette use for smokers in rural Appalachia.",

Patients that are able to receive CAR T-cell therapy have a potential for cure, however, many will not be qualified to receive therapy due to relapse. Bridging therapy is therapy intended to transition a patient from one therapy or medication to another or maintain their health or status until they are a candidate for a therapy or have decided on a therapy. Golcadomide may help block the formation, growth or spread of cancer cells. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving golcadomide and rituximab as bridging therapy before CAR T-cell therapy may kill more tumor cells and may improve the chance of proceeding to CAR T-cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",

An MCD test measures markers in the blood in order to screen for multiple cancers simultaneously. There is a need to understand how MCDs may work as cancer screening tools. The goal of cancer screening is to reduce the burden of cancer by identifying cancers before they show symptoms or signs, when treatment is likely to be most effective. In this study, adults aged 45-75 without cancer will be randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: 2 separate MCD test groups or a control group. These two MCD tests will not be compared to each other but will be compared to cancers detected in the control group. This study will provide early information on how well MCD tests perform as cancer screening tools. It will also help researchers understand how patients and their doctors make decisions about their care when the MCD test result comes back as normal (negative) or abnormal (positive).",

      "summary": "Genes give your body instructions on how to make proteins. Proteins are needed to keep the body working properly. Many types of cancer are caused by changes in certain genes, making them faulty. Some people with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a faulty ALK gene. ALK stands for anaplastic lymphoma kinase. People with NSCLC who have the faulty ALK gene are called ALK-positive. ALK inhibitors are an approved treatment for people with ALK positive NSCLC. Some people stop responding to treatment with ALK inhibitors over time due to more changes happening in their faulty ALK gene, so there is an unmet medical need. Gilteritinib is an approved treatment for people with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the faulty FLT3 gene who haven't responded to previous treatment, or their cancer came back after previous treatment. Gilteritinib also blocks changes in the ALK gene which could help people with ALK-positive NSCLC. A study needs to be done with gilteritinib in people with ALK-positive NSCLC.\n\nThe main aim of the study is to check the safety of gilteritinib in people with ALK-positive NSCLC and if they tolerate gilteritinib.\n\nPeople in this study will be adults with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. They have stopped responding to treatment with ALK inhibitors, including alectinib or lorlatinib, over time. The key reasons people cannot take part are if they have symptomatic cancers in the brain or nervous system, their cancer has spread to the thin tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord (leptomengingeal metastasis), have recently had or planning to have major surgery, have certain heart conditions, or have recently had an infection, a stroke or mini-stroke.\n\nPeople in the study will take tablets of gilteritinib once a day in a 28-day cycle. They may be given up to 2 different doses of gilteritinib. People in the study will start on the lower dose but can eventually switch to the higher dose if they tolerate the lower dose and meet the safety checks.\n\nWhilst taking gilteritinib, people will have regular scans of their tumors. People will continue taking gilteritinib until their cancer gets worse, they have medical problems from gilteritinib that they can't tolerate, they ask to stop taking gilteritinib, they start other cancer treatment or, sadly pass away. People will visit the clinic about 7 days and then 30 days after they stop taking gilteritinib. They will be asked about any medical problems and will have a safety check. After this, people who stopped taking gilteritinib, but their cancer hadn't become worse, will continue to have regular scans of their tumors. If their cancer does get worse, they will no longer have scans of their tumors. After finishing gilteritinib, people will be phoned every 12 weeks to check on their health. People will be in the study for up to 4 years, depending on how they respond to gilteritinib.",

      "summary": "This clinical trial studies whether tailored patient navigation (PN) works to improve the uptake of lung cancer screening (LCS) in tribal communities in western Washington state. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States among American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) people, and the incidence of lung cancer is higher in this population in the Northern and Southern Plains, Alaska, and Pacific Coast regions. In Washington state, AI/AN people also have twice the rate of commercial cigarette smoking than the overall population. LCS with annual low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) can reduce lung cancer death and is recommended in people 50-80 years of age with current or recent (within 15 years) tobacco use and a 20 pack-year or greater smoking history. Despite this, AI and AN people are less likely to receive LCS which may be due to barriers they face making it difficult to receive LCS. PN services are designed to guide a patient through the healthcare system and reduce barriers to timely screening, follow-up, diagnosis, treatment, and supportive care. The PN services in this trial have been tailored for the tribal communities in western Washington state. The services are designed to help participants overcome the unique barriers that their tribal communities face and improve the uptake of LCS.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests the safety and side effects of psilocybin in combination with therapy for the treatment of major depressive disorder in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. A cancer diagnosis is life-changing, resulting in significant levels of psychological symptoms, including a combination of depression, anxiety, stress, including feelings of existential distress (i.e., loss of meaning, demoralization, despair). Among all cancer patients, those diagnosed with lung cancer have the highest prevalence of mood disorders, such as depression (up to 40%) leading to profound deterioration in quality of life, prolonged hospital stays, poorer treatment adherence, decreased survival rates, and high rates of suicide (5- and 3-times higher than the general population and other cancer patients, respectively). Psilocybin is substance being studied in the treatment of anxiety or depression in patients with advanced cancer. It is taken from the mushroom Psilocybe mexicana. Psilocybin acts on the brain to cause hallucinations (sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or touches that a person believes to be real but are not real). Psilocybin in combination with therapy may be safe and effective in treating major depressive disorder in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. Brentuximab vedotin is in a class of medications called antibody-drug conjugates. It is made of a monoclonal antibody called brentuximab that is linked to a cytotoxic agent called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30 positive lymphoma cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Dacarbazine is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's DNA and may kill cancer cells and slow down or stop cancer growth. Pembrolizumab in combination chemotherapy may be a safe and effective alternative treatment option for frail patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who can't receive standard anthracycline-based treatment.",
