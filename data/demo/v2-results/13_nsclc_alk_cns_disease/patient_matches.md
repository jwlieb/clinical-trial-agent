# Patient-Trial Match Report

*Generated: 2026-01-05 18:33:41*

## Patient Profile

- **Age**: 42
- **Sex**: Male
- **Cancer Type**: NSCLC
- **Biomarkers**: ALK rearrangement

**Clinical Description**:
> 42-year-old male with ALK-rearranged metastatic NSCLC (EML4-ALK variant 1). CNS-dominant disease with multiple brain metastases (>10 lesions, largest 2.1cm) and leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI. Systemic disease stable on alectinib x18 months but clear CNS progression. Prior crizotinib x8 months. No WBRT yet - oncology preference to avoid if possible. Mild headaches, no focal neurological deficits. CSF cytology positive for malignant cells. Seeking trials with enhanced CNS penetration or leptomeningeal disease focus. Otherwise healthy, never smoker.

### [NCT03851445](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03851445)

**LUNGMAP: A Master Protocol To Evaluate Biomarker-Driven Therapies And Immunotherapies In Previously-Treated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Lung-Map Screening Study)**

- **Sponsor**: SWOG Cancer Research Network
- **Phase**: Phase 2/Phase 3
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 30%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Male
- Age: 42
- Cancer type: NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer)
- Biomarkers: ALK rearrangement
- ECOG status: 1
- Prior therapies: crizotinib, alectinib

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Brain metastases: active - trial criteria may exclude patients with significant brain metastases.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Must confirm adequacy of tumor tissue and whether a fresh biopsy is needed.
- CSF cytology positive for malignant cells may complicate eligibility depending on trial interpretation of CNS disease.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial's focus on NSCLC, but significant uncertainties exist regarding eligibility, particularly concerning active brain metastases, which may lead to exclusion.

### [NCT05384626](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05384626)

**A Phase 1/2 Study of the Selective Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Inhibitor NVL-655 in Patients With Advanced NSCLC and Other Solid Tumors (ALKOVE-1)**

- **Sponsor**: Nuvalent Inc.
- **Phase**: Phase 1/Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 25%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age >= 18 years
- Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic NSCLC with documented ALK rearrangement

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Active brain metastases could be a concern regarding eligibility based on organ function/therapy criteria
- Patient is currently experiencing CNS progression with multiple brain metastases which may not qualify for trials focused on CNS penetration
- Prior therapies including crizotinib and alectinib conflicts with the trial's treatment line requirements if marked as first-line or treatment-naive

**? Uncertainties:**
- Adequate organ function and bone marrow reserve specifics are not provided
- The implications of the current treatment preference by the oncology team (avoiding WBRT and ongoing CNS complications) need further clarity

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial, but significant concerns about current disease status (active brain metastases) and prior treatment history suggest substantial barriers to eligibility, leading to a low likelihood of matching.

### [NCT04899908](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04899908)

**A Double-blind, Phase II Randomized Study of Brain-directed Stereotactic Radiation With or Without AGuIX Gadolinium-based Nanoparticles in the Management of Brain Metastases at Higher Risk of Local Recurrence With Radiation Alone**

- **Sponsor**: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
- **Phase**: Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 20%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age: 42
- Sex: male
- Cancer type: NSCLC
- Biomarkers: ALK rearrangement
- ECOG status: 1

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has active brain metastases and widespread definitive leptomeningeal disease, which is an exclusion criterion.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Estimated glomerular filtration rate is not provided.
- Estimated survival based on extracranial disease is not provided.
- Ability to understand and willingness to sign informed consent is not provided.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's condition is NSCLC, which matches the trial's focus on lung cancer, but the active brain metastases with widespread definitive leptomeningeal disease conflict with the exclusion criteria. This significantly affects eligibility. Uncertainties regarding organ function and estimated survival further lower the confidence in eligibility.
