## 🟢 HIGH Likelihood (2 trials)

### [NCT05910307](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05910307)

**Synovial Sarcoma Registry and Biospecimen Repository**

- **Sponsor**: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
- **Phase**: N/A
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 85%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has a reported diagnosis of synovial sarcoma
- Patient is treatment-naive (no prior systemic therapy)
- Patient is aged 28, which meets the age requirement
- Patient has an ECOG status of 0
- Patient has no brain metastases

**? Uncertainties:**
- Comprehensive molecular profiling pending; however, it is not a stated criterion in exclusion criteria

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial studying synovial sarcoma, and the patient is treatment-naive, meeting the inclusion criteria effectively. All other relevant eligibility factors are satisfied, resulting in a high likelihood of match.

### [NCT05227326](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05227326)

**First in Human Phase 1 Study of AOH1996 in Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors**

- **Sponsor**: City of Hope Medical Center
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 85%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has synovial sarcoma, which is included in the trial conditions.
- Patient is treatment-naive with no prior systemic therapy.
- Patient's ECOG status is 0.
- Patient is 28 years old, which meets the age requirement of ≥ 18 years.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Lab values for ANC, platelet counts, liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin), and creatinine clearance are not provided.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's disease type matches the trial indication for synovial sarcoma, and she is treatment-naive which aligns with the trial requirements. Age and ECOG status also meet the criteria. However, organ function lab values are not available, leading to some uncertainty.
