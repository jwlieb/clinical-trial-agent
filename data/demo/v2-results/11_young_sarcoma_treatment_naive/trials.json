NK cells, white blood cells important to the immune system, are donated/collected from cord blood collected at birth from healthy babies and grown in the lab. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving NK cells together with cyclophosphamide and etoposide may work better in treating children and young adults with solid tumors.",

      "summary": "Background:\n\nMetastasis is the spread of cancer from one organ to a nonadjacent organ. It causes 90% of cancer deaths. No treatment specifically prevents or reduces metastasis. Researchers hope a new drug can help. It stops cancer cells from growing and spreading further and possibly shrink cancer lesions in distant organs.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo find a safe dose of metarrestin and to see if this dose shrinks tumors.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults age 18 and older with pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, or a solid tumor that has not been cured by standard therapies. Also, children age 12-17 with a solid tumor (other than a muscle tumor) with no standard therapy options.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\n* blood tests\n* physical exam\n* documentation of disease confirmation or tumor biopsy\n* electrocardiogram to evaluate the heart\n* review of their medicines and their ability to do their normal activities\n\nParticipants will take metarrestin by mouth until they cannot tolerate it or stop to benefit from it. They will keep a medicine diary.\n\nParticipants will visit the Clinical Center. During the first month there are two brief hospital stays required with visits weekly or every other week thereafter. They will repeat some of the screening tests. They will fill out questionnaires. They will have tests of their cognitive function. They will have an electroencephalogram to record brain activity. They will have a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A CT is a series of X-rays of the body. An MRI uses magnets and radio waves to take pictures of the body.\n\nAdult participants may have tumor biopsies.\n\nParticipants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends. Then they will have follow-up phone calls or emails every 6 months for the rest of their life or until the study ends.",

      "summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the basis for three widely held fundamental tenets about surgical intervention for thumb basal joint arthritis;\n\n1. Trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and metacarpal stabilization is associated with superior functional outcomes and strength,\n2. Preservation of the arthroplasty space correlates with functional outcomes, pain relief, and restoration of strength after basal joint arthroplasty, and\n3. Mitigation of metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) hyperextension optimizes postoperative strength after basal joint arthroplasty, regardless of surgical technique.\n\nIt is hypothesized that thumb basal joint arthroplasty with metacarpal stabilization, by either ligament reconstruction (I) or suture suspension (II), provides greater improvement in grip and pinch strength, and better hand function, than might be achieved following provision of pain relief alone by simple trapeziectomy (III). Preservation of the arthroplasty space will correlate positively, and MCPJ hyperextension will correlate negatively, with improved thumb function and lateral pinch strength.\n\nPrimary Aims (within 3 procedure cohorts):\n\n1. Compare pre-operative pinch and grip strength as well as patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for pain in patients before and after lidocaine injection of the trapeziometacarpal joint, prior to thumb basal joint arthroplasty;\n2. Compare post-operative pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and function at 3 and 6 months after thumb basal joint arthroplasty with pre-operative values before and after lidocaine injection;\n3. Correlate preservation of dynamic arthroplasty space as measured on a stress radiograph with postoperative improvement in pinch and grip strength, and PROs for pain and function;\n4. Correlate dynamic MCP joint position and laxity with change in strength and patient-reported pain and function to define optimal MCPJ position.\n\nSecondary Aims (between 3 procedure cohorts):\n\n1. Compare change in pre- and post-operative pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and function between patients having basal joint arthroplasty with and without specific metacarpal stabilization;\n2. Compare preservation of the dynamic arthroplasty space and improvement in strength and patient-reported pain and function between arthroplasty groups; and\n3. Compare changes in pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and function with dynamic MCPJ position between arthroplasty groups.\n4. Compare postoperative neuritis and complications between surgical groups.",

      "summary": "The phase I portion of this study is designed for children or adolescents and young adults (AYA) with a diagnosis of a solid tumor that has recurred (come back after treatment) or is refractory (never completely went away). The trial will test 2 combinations of therapy and participants will be randomly assigned to either Arm A or Arm B. The purpose of the phase I study is to determine the highest tolerable doses of the combinations of treatment given in each Arm.\n\nIn Arm A, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors will receive 2 medications called Onivyde and talazoparib. Onivyde works by damaging the DNA of the cancer cell and talazoparib works by blocking the repair of the DNA once the cancer cell is damaged. By damaging the tumor DNA and blocking the repair, the cancer cells may die. In Arm B, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors will receive 2 medications called Onivyde and temozolomide. Both of these medications work by damaging the DNA of the cancer call which may cause the tumor(s) to die.\n\nOnce the highest doses are reached in Arm A and Arm B, then \"expansion Arms\" will open. An expansion arm treats more children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors at the highest doses achieved in the phase I study. The goal of the expansion arms is to see if the tumors go away in children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. There will be 3 \"expansion Arms\". In Arm A1, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (excluding Ewing sarcoma) will receive Onivyde and talazoparib. In Arm A2, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, whose tumors have a problem with repairing DNA (identified by their doctor), will receive Onivyde and talazoparib. In Arm B1, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (excluding Ewing sarcoma) will receive Onivyde and temozolomide.\n\nOnce the highest doses of medications used in Arm A and Arm B are determined, then a phase II study will open for children or young adults with Ewing sarcoma that has recurred or is refractory following treatment received after the initial diagnosis. The trial will test the same 2 combinations of therapy in Arm A and Arm B. In the phase II, a participant with Ewing sarcoma will be randomly assigned to receive the treatment given on either Arm A or Arm B.",

      "summary": "The purpose of this study is to learn whether it is safe to give HER2-CAR T cells in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug (pembrolizumab or nivolumab), to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with sarcoma.\n\nAnother goal of this study is to study the bacteria found in the stool of patients with sarcoma who are being treated with HER2 CAR T cells and immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs to see if the types of bacteria influence how well the treatment works.\n\nThe investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. They now want to see if they can put a new gene in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells. The new gene that the investigators will put in makes an antibody specific for HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) that binds to sarcoma cells. In addition, it contains CD28, which stimulated T cells and make them last longer. After this new gene is put into the T cell, the T cell becomes known as a chimeric antigen receptor T cell or CAR T cell.\n\nIn another clinical study using these CAR T cells targeting HER2 as well as other studies using CAR T cells, investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the effect the T cells can have. Giving chemotherapy before a T cell infusion is called lymphodepletion since the chemotherapy is specifically chosen to decrease the number of lymphocytes in the body. Decreasing the number of the patient's lymphocytes first should allow the infused T cells to expand in the body, and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively.\n\nThe chemotherapy used for lymphodepletion is a combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.\n\nAfter the patient receives the lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR T cells during treatment on the study, they will receive an antibody drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab or nivolumab. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are drugs that remove the brakes on the immune system to allow it to act against cancer.",

      "summary": "The goal of this clinical research trial is to study the use of differing investigational doses and scheduling for Proton Therapy for tumors previously treated with radiation therapy. Generally, when patients are first treated for cancer with radiation therapy, they are treated with traditional photon (or x-ray) radiation therapy, which uses high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. In some cases, the cancer either returns or a new tumor can present in a different part of the body. With the usual radiation treatment, the photon beams travel all the way through the body. As a result, healthy tissues in front of and behind the tumor are exposed to radiation. Physicians who treat these cases where the tumor has returned often use a much lower dose of radiation to prevent patients from experiencing serious and long-term side-effects. This dose is often not strong enough to destroy the cancerous tumor. Alternatively, they may also treat a smaller area than would be indicated for complete tumor eradication, again in an attempt to prevent serious and long-term toxicities, but at the cost of optimally treating the cancer. Proton therapy, however, may offer a chance to safely deliver a more effective dose and volume of radiation as it is more targeted and can spare healthy tissues surrounding the tumor.\n\nThe reason we are conducting this research study is to look at whether Proton therapy can be a better way to treat reoccurring tumors in patients who have previously received radiation therapy to the same area, compared to treatment approaches used to date.",

A minority of patients benefit from treatment with chemotherapy and early biomarkers of benefit from treatment are lacking. A biomarker of tumor response and patient survival benefit from chemotherapy early in the course of chemotherapy would be of significant impact in treatment planning. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is present in blood of patients with advanced/metastatic cancer and may serve as biomarker of tumor response to chemotherapy. Blood samples will be collected prior to and during and chemotherapy, and analyzed for ctDNA and for mutations in genes that are associated with increased risk of developing sarcoma. Tumor tissue will be collected and analyzed for changes in genes. Digital images of the sarcoma from CT or MRI scans obtained during treatment will be obtained for advanced radiomic analysis.

      "summary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of combination therapy with liposomal doxorubicin and peposertib in treating patients with sarcoma that has spread from where it first started, to other places in the body (metastatic), or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and for which no known cure is available (advanced). Doxorubicin is in a class of medications called anthracyclines. Doxorubicin damages the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It also blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair. Liposomal doxorubicin is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained inside very tiny, fat-like particles. Liposomal doxorubicin may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of the drug. Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also enhance the activity of chemo- and radiotherapy. There is some pre-clinical evidence in animal models that combining peposertib with liposomal doxorubicin can shrink or stabilize certain types of cancer for longer than either drug alone, but it is not known if this will happen in people. Combination therapy with liposomal doxorubicin and peposertib may be effective in treating patients with advanced sarcoma.",

These participants were no longer benefiting from standard medications and had no good treatment options. In that study, some participants who were treated with linvoseltamab had improvement of their myeloma (shrinkage of their tumors), including some participants who had complete responses (that is, the treatment got rid of all evidence of myeloma in their bodies).\n\nThis study is focused on participants who have multiple myeloma that has returned or needs to be treated again after one to four prior treatments and have standard cancer treatment options available to them. The aim of this study is to see how safe and effective linvoseltamab is compared to a combination of three cancer drugs: elotuzumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone, (called EPd) in participants who have returned after having received prior treatment that included lenalidomide, a proteosome inhibitor, and (for participants in some countries) a cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) antibody. Half of the participants in this study will get linvoseltamab, and the other half will get EPd.\n\nThis study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* How long participants benefit from receiving linvoseltamab compared with EPd\n* How many participants treated with linvoseltamab or EPd have improvement of their multiple myeloma and by how much\n* What side effects happen from taking linvoseltamab compared to EPd\n* How long participants live while receiving treatment or after treatment with linvoseltamab compared to EPd\n* If there is any improvement in pain after treatment with linvoseltamab compared to EPd",

SCD can cause anemia and life-threatening complications in the lungs, heart, kidney, and nerves. People with SCD are also at increased risk of forming blood clots in the veins and lungs, but the standard treatments for these clots can cause increased bleeding in people with SCD. Better treatments are needed.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a drug (fostamatinib) in people with SCD.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 to 65 with SCD.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 6 clinic visits over 12 weeks. Each visit will be 2 to 3 hours.\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. They will tell the researchers about the medications they take.\n\nFostamatinib is a tablet taken by mouth. Participants will take the drug at home, twice a day, for up to 6 weeks.\n\nParticipants will have a clinic visit every 2 weeks while they are taking the drug. At each visit they will have a physical exam with blood tests. They will talk about any side effects the drug may be causing. If they are tolerating the drug well after the first 2 weeks, they may begin taking a higher dose.\n\nParticipants will have a final visit 4 weeks after they stop taking the drug.

      "summary": "Postural instability is a common symptom of vestibular dysfunction that impacts a person's day-to-day activities. Vestibular rehabilitation is effective in decreasing dizziness, visual symptoms and improving postural control through several mechanisms including sensory reweighting. As part of the sensory reweighting mechanisms, vestibular activation training with headshake activities influence vestibular reflexes. However, combining challenging vestibular and postural tasks to facilitate more effective rehabilitation outcomes is under-utilized. The novel concurrent headshake and weight shift training (Concurrent HS-WST) is purported to train the vestibular system to directly impact the postural control system simultaneously and engage sensory reweighting to improve balance. Young healthy participants will perform the training by donning a virtual reality headset with an overhead harness on and a spotter present to prevent any falls. The investigators propose that this training strategy would show improved outcomes over traditional training methods by improving vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) gains, eye movement variability, sensory reweighting and promoting postural balance. The findings of this study may guide clinicians to develop rehabilitation methods for vestibular postural control in neurological populations with vestibular and/or sensorimotor control impairment.",

      "summary": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can cure patients with blood cancer and other underlying diseases. \u03b1\u03b2-T cell and B cell depletion has been introduced to decrease GVHD and PTLD and has demonstrated effectiveness for hematologic malignancies and non-malignant diseases additionally increasing the donor pool as to allow for haploidentical transplant to safely occur.\n\nWhile solid tumors can be highly chemotherapy sensitive, many remain resistant and require multimodalities of treatment. Immunotherapy has been developed to harness the immune system in fighting solid tumors, though not all have targeted effects. Some solid tumors are treated with autologous transplants; however, they do not always demonstrate an improved event free survival or overall survival. There has been evidence of the use of allogeneic stem cell transplants to provide a graft versus tumor effect, though studies remain limited.\n\nBy utilizing \u03b1\u03b2-T cell and B cell depletion for stem cell transplants and combining with zoledronic acid, the immune system may potentially be harnessed and enhanced to provide an improved graft versus tumor effect in relapsed/refractory solid tumors and promote an improved event-free survival and overall survival.\n\nThis study will investigate the safety of treatment with a stem cell graft depleted of \u03b1\u03b2-T cell and CD19+ B cells in combination with zoledronic acid in pediatric and young adult patients with select solid tumors, as well as whether this treatment improves survival rates in these patients.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the effect of ASTX727 in combination with iadademstat to ASTX727 alone in treating patients with accelerated or blast phase Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs, cedazuridine and decitabine. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Iadademstat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving ASTX727 in combination with iadademstat may be more effective than ASTX727 alone in treating patients with accelerated or blast phase Philadelphia chromosome negative MPNs.",

In CIDP, the immune system attacks the protective covering around the nerves called myelin. Over time, these nerves lose their ability to send signals to the muscles in the body. This leads to muscle weakness and loss of sensation in arms and legs among other symptoms. Participants with CIDP can be treated with a protein called immunoglobulin (or IG).\n\nTAK-411 is a special type of immune globulin G (hsIgG) that has been chemically changed. It is made from IG that comes from human plasma. This study will test if TAK-411 can decrease inflammation and improve symptoms of CIDP.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to check how TAK-411 affects the physical functioning of adults with CIDP when compared with results of the placebo group of a historical trial.\n\nParticipants may be treated with TAK-411 for up to 1 year (51 weeks) and will be followed up for 3 weeks after last dose.\n\nDuring the study, participants may visit their study clinic up to approximately 21 times.",

Oncolytic viruses are designed to infect and destroy cancer cells and have the potential to stimulate the immune system to fight the tumor.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the safety of IDOV-Immune, how well it is tolerated, and to identify the highest dose that can be safely given. Researchers will also study how the drug behaves in the body, how the immune system responds to it, and whether it shows any signs of shrinking tumors.\n\nParticipants will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion of IDOV-Immune and will be closely monitored for side effects and any changes in their cancer.\n\nThis study is being conducted at multiple sites in the United States and Australia.",

People can join the study if they have been diagnosed with chronic HF at least 3 months before the study. The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called vicadrostat, in combination with another medicine called empagliflozin, helps people with chronic heart failure.\n\nIn this study, participants are put into 2 groups randomly. Participants have an equal chance of being in either group. One group takes vicadrostat/empagliflozin tablets, and the other group takes placebo/empagliflozin tablets. Placebo tablets look like vicadrostat tablets but do not contain any medicine. Participants take the study medicines as tablets once a day for between 1 and about 3.5 years. During this time, they can continue their regular treatment for heart failure.\n\nParticipants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it, for a maximum of about 3.5 years. During this time, they visit the study site regularly. The exact number of visits is different for each participant, depending on how long they stay in the study. The study staff may also contact the participants by phone. Participants also regularly answer questions about their well-being. The doctors document when participants experience worsening of their heart failure symptoms, must go to hospital due to heart failure, or die during the study. The time until these events are observed is compared between the treatment groups to see whether the treatment works. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.",

Only cases where a complete surgical resection can safely be achieved are defined as resectable.\n* Patients must have life expectancy \\> 6 months.\n* ECOG performance status \u22642 (Karnofsky \u226560%)\n* For patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: stable anticoagulant regimen\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\nabsolute neutrophil count \u22651,000/mcL platelets \u2265100,000/mcL total bilirubin \u2264 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u22643 \u00d7 institutional ULN creatinine \u2264 eGFR \u226540 ml/min\n\n* Negative HIV test at screening, with the following exception: patients with a positive HIV test at screening are eligible provided they are stable on anti-retroviral therapy, have a CD4 count \u2265 200/L, and have an undetectable viral load\n* Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test at screening (if relevant)\n* Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test at screening, or positive HCV antibody test followed by a negative HCV RNA test at screening (if relevant)\n\n  a. The HCV RNA test must be performed for patients who have a positive HCV antibody test.\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.\n* The effects of Atezolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because doxorubicin as used in this trial is known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. (Refer to Pregnancy Assessment Policy MD Anderson Institutional Policy #\n\nCLN1114). This includes all female patients, between the onset of menses (as early as 8 years of age) and 55 years unless the patient presents with an applicable exclusionary factor which may be one of the following:\n\n* Postmenopausal (no menses in greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months).\n* History of hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\n* Ovarian failure (Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Estradiol in menopausal range)\n* History of bilateral tubal ligation or another surgical sterilization procedure.\n\n  * For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods, and agreement to refrain from donating eggs, as defined below:\n  * Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period and for 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab after the final dose of doxorubicin. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.\n  * A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is post-menarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (\u2265 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., M\u00fcllerian agenesis). Per this definition, a woman with a tubal ligation is considered to be of childbearing potential. The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.\n\n    a. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% per year include: i. bilateral tubal ligation ii. male sterilization iii. hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation iv. hormone-releasing intrauterine devices v. copper intrauterine devices.\n  * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\n  * Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Disease that is considered surgically unresectable, including, but not limited to significant vascular, neural, or bone involvement, and in cases where a complete surgical resection cannot be safely performed.\n* Prior chemotherapy or targeted small molecule therapy for the current sarcoma. History of previous systemic treatments for other cancers is allowable. This exclusion criteria also applies to patients who present with locally recurrent disease.\n* Prior treatment with radiotherapy to the site of the sarcoma (re-irradiation or radiationinduced sarcomas are not allowed on this study)\n* Metastatic disease or regional lymph node involvement. Chest CT will be mandatory prior to enrollment to evaluate for the presence of metastatic disease. Pulmonary nodule(s) \\< 7 mm without a histological diagnosis may not be the basis for studyexclusion giventhelackof specificityof chest CT.If pulmonary nodule(s) measuring 6 - 10 mm are noted on chest CT but appear stable relative to prior chest imaging of at least 6 months duration or if 18FDG-PET scan indicates that the nodule(s) are unlikely to be metastatic disease, then this is permitted. Pulmonary nodules \\>10 mm should be considered metastatic unless proven otherwise by biopsy/resection or stable appearance for at least 6 months on imaging.\n* Active concurrent second malignancy within 2 years of trial enrollment. Note: patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial. Examples include non-melanomatous skin cancer, in situ carcinoma, or low-risk prostate cancer.\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan\n* Currently receiving cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy) or investigational anti-cancer drug within 8 weeks of trial enrollment.\n* Prior or concurrent immunotherapy, including treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, antiPD-L2, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody; tumor vaccines; interferon, or interleukins.\n* Recent stroke or thromboembolic event (within 6 months) requiring anticoagulation that cannot be interrupted.
