## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Measurable disease status** (per RECIST 1.1) - required for most therapeutic trials
- **Life expectancy estimate** - many trials require ≥3 months
