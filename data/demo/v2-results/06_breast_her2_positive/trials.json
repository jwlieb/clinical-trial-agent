We also hope to learn the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.\n\nIn this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor cells.\n\nInvestigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. Both CAdVEC and HER2-specific autologous CAR T are investigational products. They are not approved by the FDA.",

Current treatment of breast cancer uses clinical subtype information (e.g. hormone receptor-positive (HR+)) to help guide treatment options. Breast cancer can also be characterized by molecular subtype, but it is not known if this information is helpful in determining treatment when breast cancer has become metastatic. HARMONY will give the treating physician of each participant the molecular subtype of the tumor based on PAM50 testing. The usefulness of this information will be determined through the physician survey. Finding out the molecular subtype of each tumor also allows the investigators to determine if the molecular subtype is different from what is expected based on the clinical subtype. This study will help determine how new types of information about tumors can help choose treatments for MBC",

      "summary": "This phase II trial studies how well the combination of avelumab with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan works in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that is stage IV or is not able to be removed by surgery (unresectable) and has come back (recurrent). Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors like avelumab require activation of the patient's immune system.\n\nThis trial includes a two week induction or lead-in of medications that can stimulate the immune system. It is our hope that this induction will improve the response to immunotherapy with avelumab. One treatment, sacituzumab Govitecan, is a monoclonal antibody called sacituzumab linked to a chemotherapy drug called SN-38. Sacituzumab govitecan is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TROP2) receptors, and delivers SN-38 to kill them. Another treatment, liposomal doxorubicin, is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained in very tiny, fat-like particles. It may have fewer side effects and work better than doxorubicin, and may enhance factors associated with immune response. The third medication is called binimetinib, which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and may help activate the immune system. It is not yet known whether giving avelumab in combination with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan will work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.",

For primary nodal lymphomas, patients with stages II-IV according to the Ann Arbor staging system are eligible.\n* Minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed since last systemic treatment or radiation therapy treatment (or 6 weeks for any nitrosourea-containing regimens), and patients must have recovered from all toxicity of last treatment. If the PI assesses that it is in the best interest of the patient to have a shorter washout period, they may submit a written request to the sponsor and can enroll the patient after written approval has been received.\n* Age \u226518 years. Both genders are included. However, women of childbearing potential must have a negative B-HCG serum pregnancy test (see Section 10 Study Calendar, Pre-Study, footnote b) and agree to use effective contraceptive methods for the duration of the study. A urine pregnancy test is required just prior to the first dosing session of every treatment cycle.\n* ECOG performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky \u226560%, see Appendix B).\n* Life expectancy greater than 6 months.\n* Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n* Leukocytes \u2265 3,000/\u03bcL\n* Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/\u03bcL\n* Platelets \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL\n* Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits.

Pregnant or breastfeeding women cannot take part in this study. Women of childbearing age are required to have a blood and/or urine pregnancy test before beginning the investigational study treatment. If you are sexually active, it is important that you not become pregnant or father a child because this medication may be harmful to your unborn child. Patients must discuss pregnancy plans with their doctor before enrolling in this study and agree that they will take the appropriate precautions not to become pregnant while enrolled in the study.\n\nIf there is any chance that patient can get pregnant, patient must either agree to not have vaginal intercourse or you must use two (2) types of birth control (hormonal, barrier method of birth control, abstinence) at the same time. These birth control methods must be used from the time of enrollment, all during investigational study treatment including during temporary breaks from therapy, and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ST-001.\n\n\u2022 Informed consent of the patient or a legal authorized representative (LAR) must be obtained prior to any study related procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients with known or history of central nervous system (CNS) disease are excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because of concerns regarding toxicity attribution.\n* History of allergic reactions or sensitivity to retinoids or to any excipients of ST-001.\n* Concomitant drug administration.\n\nPatients who require concurrent treatment with drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers are excluded from the trial. Patients who have been treated previously with strong CYP3A inducers may enroll in the trial and receive their first dose of ST-001 only after four weeks have elapsed since the last dose of the CYP3A inducer. Strong inducers of human CYP3A include barbiturates, bosentan, carbamazepine, efavirenz, enzalutamide, etravirine, systemic glucocorticoids, mitotane, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, troglitazone as well as the OTC herbal product St John's Wort (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/developmentresources/druginteractionslabeling/ucm093664.htm#table2-3; http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/it-mmfiles/Cytochrome\\_P450\\_3A4\\_and\\_3A5\\_Known\\_Drug\\_Interaction\\_Chart.pdf; http://oncologypro.esmo.org/content/download/66542/1203090/file/CYP3A-inhibitors-inducers-DDI.pdf)\n\nPatients who require concurrent treatment with drugs that are strong to moderate CYP3A inhibitors are excluded from the trial, and patients who have been treated previously with strong CYP3A inhibitors may enroll in the trial and receive their first dose of ST-001 only after four weeks have elapsed since the last dose of the CYP3A inhibitor. This group of inhibitors includes certain antivirals (boceprevir, danoprevir, paritaprevir; elvitegravir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, tipranavir; ombitasvir, dasabuvir), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin) and ciprofloxacin, antifungals (e.g., clotrimazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole, voriconazole), aprepitant, cimetidine, cobicistat, conivaptan, crizotinib, cyclosporine, diltiazem, dronedarone, idelalisib, luvoxamine, imatinib, tofisopam, suboxone and verapamil as well as dietary grapefruit juice and grapefruit (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/developmentresources/druginteractionslabeling/ucm093664.htm#table2-3; http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/it-mmfiles/Cytochrome\\_P450\\_3A4\\_and\\_3A5\\_Known\\_Drug\\_Interaction\\_Chart.pdf; http://oncologypro.esmo.org/content/download/66542/1203090/file/CYP3A-inhibitors-inducers-DDI.pdf)\n\nIf patients being treated with ST-001 require the use of drugs that are either strong inducers of CYP3A or strong to moderate inhibitors of CYP3A to treat a medical condition, all treatment with ST-001 should be discontinued immediately and no further treatment with ST-001 will be allowed.\n\nUse of acetaminophen, cephalosporins and other known hepatotoxic agents is allowed with caution and close monitoring, due to known or potential interaction with ST-001 and potential increased risk of hepatotoxicity\\[52\\]. Patients who require replacement therapy with oral steroids should be allowed to continue the treatment if treatment with stable dose has been initiated more than 2 weeks prior to beginning ST-001 infusion. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/. Medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information.\n\nAs part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product. Physician investigators should consult the websites listed above for the most current information regarding drug interactions via CYP3A isozymes.\n\nUse of vitamin A supplements is prohibited. Standard multivitamin doses are allowed.\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NY heart classification III/IV), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, QTc interval \\>450 milliseconds on baseline triplicate ECG, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ST-001is a retinoid agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ST-001, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ST-001.\n* HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ST-001. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n* Patients with any active hepatitis infections.\n* Presence of nyctalopia (night blindness), or hemeralopia (defective vision in a bright light, 'day blindness') at enrollment, or any other retinal, ophthalmological condition (eg: retinitis pigmentosa, choroidoretinitis and xerophthalmia), and glaucoma.\n* Patients who have received prior fenretinide systemic therapy\n* Patients with T-cell lymphoma types other than those specified in section 3.1.1 are not eligible even if they have cutaneous dissemination. Similarly, patients with any type of natural killer (NK)- or B-cell lymphoma are not eligible regardless of sites of involvement by disease.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial investigates how well trastuzumab deruxtecan works alone or in combination with anastrozole in treating patients with HER2 low, hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 expressed at low levels on cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Anastrozole works by decreasing estrogen production and suppressing the growth of tumors that need estrogen to grow. This study is evaluating how effective trastuzumab deruxtecan is at treating hormone receptor positive cancer cells that have low levels of HER2 expressed on them when given alone or in combination with anastrozole.",

The study will be done in three phases, described below.\n\nPhase 1a (Dose Escalation Phase):\n\nThe Phase 1a portion is designed to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of orally administered BTX-A51. BTX-A51 will be administered once daily on a weekly schedule of 5 days on/2 days off. Dose escalation will proceed according to a modified 3+3 design. Each cycle will consist of 28 days (4 weeks), and the DLT observation period will be the first cycle (i.e., 28 days after initiation of dosing). A DLT may be observed in no more than 0 out of 3 or 1 out of 6 subjects who have completed the DLT observation period before the next cohort initiates accrual. Barring DLT, sequential dose escalation of BTX-A51 is planned with up to a total of 6 dose levels; on the basis of these an MTD will be identified. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level with a subject incidence of DLTs of 0 or 1 out of 6 during the first 28 days of study drug dosing. A minimum of 6 subjects needs to be treated at a dose level before this dose level can be deemed as the MTD.\n\nPhase 1b (Monotherapy Dose Ranging Phase):\n\nDose expansion may begin when the RP2D has been determined. Up to 40 additional subjects at each of the 2 dose levels will be enrolled to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of BTX-A51 in subjects with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-), GATA3 mutant (mt) and wild-type (wt) metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Dosing in this phase of the study consists of the first cycle of therapy (i.e., 28 days).\n\nPhase 1c (Combination Safety Phase):\n\nThe Phase 1c portion will evaluate the safety and tolerability of orally administered BTX-A51 at two dose levels combined with fulvestrant. The first combo cohort may be initiated after DEC review of the 6 subject lead-in phase of the high dose monotherapy cohort in Phase 1b. Dose escalation will proceed according to a 3+3 design. Each cycle will consist of 28 days (4 weeks), and the DLT observation period will be the first cycle (i.e., 28 days after initiation of dosing).",

      "summary": "The purpose of this study is to learn whether it is safe to give HER2-CAR T cells in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug (pembrolizumab or nivolumab), to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with sarcoma.\n\nAnother goal of this study is to study the bacteria found in the stool of patients with sarcoma who are being treated with HER2 CAR T cells and immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs to see if the types of bacteria influence how well the treatment works.\n\nThe investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. They now want to see if they can put a new gene in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells. The new gene that the investigators will put in makes an antibody specific for HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) that binds to sarcoma cells. In addition, it contains CD28, which stimulated T cells and make them last longer. After this new gene is put into the T cell, the T cell becomes known as a chimeric antigen receptor T cell or CAR T cell.\n\nIn another clinical study using these CAR T cells targeting HER2 as well as other studies using CAR T cells, investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the effect the T cells can have. Giving chemotherapy before a T cell infusion is called lymphodepletion since the chemotherapy is specifically chosen to decrease the number of lymphocytes in the body. Decreasing the number of the patient's lymphocytes first should allow the infused T cells to expand in the body, and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively.\n\nThe chemotherapy used for lymphodepletion is a combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.\n\nAfter the patient receives the lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR T cells during treatment on the study, they will receive an antibody drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab or nivolumab. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are drugs that remove the brakes on the immune system to allow it to act against cancer.",

Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies and forms of targeted therapy that attach to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab or pertuzumab attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Hyaluronidase is an endoglycosidase. It helps to keep pertuzumab and trastuzumab in the body longer, so that these medications will have a greater effect. Hyaluronidase also allows trastuzumab and trastuzumab/pertuzumab to be given by injection under the skin and shortens their administration time compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab alone. Paclitaxel is a taxane and in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Giving Herceptin Hylecta or Phesgo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin may shrink the tumor and prevent the cancer from coming back in patients with HER2 positive endometrial cancer.",

Women meeting these criteria will need to use adequate contraception for at least 30 days after the last dose of abemaciclib or VS-6766 and for one year after the last dose of fulvestrant. Men will need to use adequate contraception for 90 days after the last dose of abemaciclib or VS-6766 and for one year after the last dose of fulvestrant. Additionally, males must agree not to donate sperm for the duration of protocol treatment and for at least 90 days after the last dose of protocol therapy. Childbearing potential for this purpose is defined as: those who have not been surgically sterilized and/or have had a menstrual period in the past 12 months. Adequate contraception is defined as one highly effective non-hormonal form of contraception or two effective forms of non-hormonal contraception by the participant and/or partner:\n\nHighly Effective Non-Hormonal Contraception Methods of birth control which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly are considered highly-effective forms of contraception.\n\nThe following non-hormonal methods of contraception are acceptable:\n\n* True abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. \\[Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\\].\n* Male sterilization (with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female participants, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner. OR Effective Non-Hormonal Contraception\n\nAlternatively two of the following effective forms of contraception may be used instead:\n\n* Placement of non-hormonal or progesterone-coated intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). Consideration should be given to the type of device being used, as there are higher failure rates quoted for certain types, e.g., steel or copper wire.\n* Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.\n* Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.\n* The use of barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of spermicide. The following should be noted:\n* Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not highly effective forms of contraception. Therefore, the use of additional spermicides does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.\n* However, spermicides alone are ineffective at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spilled. Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be used alone.\n\nIt should be noted that two forms of effective contraception are required. A double barrier method is acceptable, which is defined as condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.\n\n* A female of childbearing potential, as defined above in section 3.1.12, must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days of C1D1. A positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum test. Pregnancy testing does not need to be pursued in female participants who are:\n\n  * Age \\>60 years; or\n  * Age \\<60 years with intact uterus and amenorrhea for 12 consecutive months or more AND estrogen (estradiol) levels within postmenopausal range; or\n  * Status post bilateral oophorectomy, total hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation\n* Participant must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants with active brain metastases or with known carcinomatous meningitis. Stable, treated brain metastases are allowed (this includes participants who have documented radiologic stability at least 4 weeks after radiotherapy, and do not require systemic steroids for management of symptoms from CNS metastatic lesions). Any patients with documented brain metastasis not meeting above criteria for stable treated brain metastasis are considered to have active brain metastases.\n* Phase I: Participants who have discontinued prior abemaciclib for toxicity, at any dose. Phase II: Participants who have discontinued prior abemaciclib for toxicity, if that toxicity occurred at or above the RP2 dose level for abemaciclib that is incorporated into phase II of this trial.\n* Participants who have discontinued prior fulvestrant for toxicity.\n* Prior treatment with any MEK inhibitor.\n* The subject has received another investigational agent within at least 30 days or 5 half-lives of the first dose of study drug, whichever is longer, or is currently enrolled in any medical device research or other research that is judged by the sponsor to not be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.\n* The subject has received a chemotherapy agent or immunotherapy within 21 days of the first dose of study drug.\n* The subject has received an endocrine or biologic agent within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.\n* The subject has completed radiation within 14 days of registration. Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the acute effects of radiotherapy.\n* The subject has had major surgery within 14 days of registration.\n* Participants with the following pre-existing ocular pathology are excluded:\n* Patients with history of glaucoma, history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), predisposing factors for RVO, including uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes.\n* Patient with history of retinal pathology or evidence of visible retinal pathology that is considered a risk factor for RVO, intraocular pressure \\> 21 mm Hg as measured by tonometry, or other significant ocular pathology, such as anatomical abnormalities that increase the risk for RVO.\n* Patients with a history of corneal erosion (instability of corneal epithelium), corneal degeneration, active or recurrent keratitis, and other forms of serious ocular surface inflammatory conditions.\n* History of rhabdomyolysis or neuromuscular disorders that are associated with elevated CK (eg inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy).\n* The patient has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV), active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous six months, syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, severe obstructive pulmonary disease, or severe chronic liver or renal disease, or sudden cardiac arrest.\n* Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are potentially eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years and there is no evidence of disease recurrence for 1 year or more since completion of appropriate therapy: cervical cancer in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Patients with other cancers diagnosed within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed with the overall study PI to determine eligibility.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to VS-6766 (including inactive ingredients mannitol, magnesium stearate, HPMC (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) shells), abemaciclib, or fulvestrant.\n* Known history of testing positive for HIV with history of an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within the past 12 months, or need to receive combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.\n* Known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive). Screening is not required for enrollment. Patients with chronic HBV infection who meet criteria for anti-HBV therapy should be on suppressive antiviral therapy prior to initiation of study therapy. Patients with a history of HCV infection will need to have completed curative antiviral treatment with HCV viral load below the limit of quantification. Patients with untreated HCV may be enrolled if the HCV is stable and if the patient is not at risk for hepatic decompensation. Patients that need to receive antiviral therapy for HBV or HCV that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers will be excluded.\n* Patients exposed to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drugs (see Appendix C). Concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (see Appendix C), such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, or inducers (see Appendix C), such as St. John's wort, should be avoided during the study treatment.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because effect of combination VS-766, abemaciclib, and fulvestrant on a developing fetus is unknown. Breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to entry onto the study.\n* Patients with the inability to swallow oral medications, impaired gastrointestinal absorption due to gastrectomy or other major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, or other medical issue that would impact absorption of oral medication in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Patients with active systemic bacterial infection (requiring intravenous \\[IV\\] antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment), or fungal infection (requiring IV antifungal treatment at time of initiating study treatment), or severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection \u226428 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Patients on treatment with warfarin. Individuals on treatment with warfarin must be transitioned to anticoagulation instead with low-molecular-weight heparin or a direct oral anticoagulant prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Any other serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) (e.g. interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, other cardiac, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, psychiatric, neurological, or genetic conditions, etc.) that in the opinion of the Investigator would place the patient at unacceptably high risk for toxicity and therefore preclude participation in this study.",

      "summary": "The majority of patients (pts) with breast cancer have hormone receptor positive (HR+) disease, and this holds true for pts with advanced breast cancer (ABC). Currently frontline therapy for pts with HR+ ABC is antihormonal therapy with an aromatase inhibitor or selective estrogen receptor degrader plus a CDK4/6i. The proposed trial is a randomized study to further evaluate the potential benefit of switching a frontline regimen at the time that a molecular signal, ctDNA, suggests progression prior to detection of clinical progression using standard methods. The purpose of this study is to determine whether switching treatment earlier in the disease process, based on molecular progression, will increase the amount of time that a patient's metastatic breast cancer is controlled compared to patients with metastatic breast cancer who receive treatment later based on diagnostic imaging results or other methods currently used in medical practice.",

      "summary": "This is a research study to find out if a drug called belantamab mafodotin in combination with dexamethasone, a steroid, can be safely and effectively given in the community setting. Belantamab mafodotin (BLENREP) was approved in the US in August 2020 under an FDA program called accelerated approval. In November 2022, belantamab mafodotin was removed from the market because a study to further confirm its activity in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma did not deliver a supporting result. However, this confirmatory study demonstrated that some patients may still benefit from treatment with belantamab mafodotin, and that this benefit can be long lasting. Belantamab mafodotin is often given at large academic medical centers every 3 weeks. This study will assess whether it is possible to administer belantamab in the community setting every 6 weeks. It is unknown if administering belantamab every 6 weeks versus every 3 weeks will result in improved safety and/or reduced efficacy.",

      "summary": "This phase Ib trial tests the safety, side effects and best dose of anti-HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1 T-cell receptor (TCR)-transduced autologous T lymphocytes (A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells) in treating patients with NY-ESO-1 overexpression positive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed/recurrent) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory), and that may have spread from where it first started (primary site) to nearby tissue, lymph nodes (advanced) or to other places in the body (metastatic). NY-ESO-1 is an antigen found on the surface of many different types of tumor cells including TNBC. Antigens make it possible for immune cells to recognize and kill germ cells that invade the body, however, it is more difficult for immune cells to recognize antigens on tumor cells. T cells are a special type of immune cell in the blood. These T cells may be trained to recognize the NY-ESO-1 antigen on tumor cells, allowing the T cells to attack and kill those tumor cells. The A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells are T cells that have been removed from the patient's blood through a process called leukapheresis and then changed in the laboratory to recognize NY-ESO-1 on tumor cells. When given back to the patient, these A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells find and attack tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. They are given before the T cells to support optimum activity of the A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells. IL-2 (aldesleukin) is in a class of drugs known as cytokines. It is a man-made version of a naturally occurring protein that stimulates the body to produce other chemicals which increase the body's ability to fight cancer. A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells may kill more tumor cells in patients with recurrent or refractory advanced or metastatic TNBC that overexpresses NY-ESO-1.",

Given the long duration of AI treatment for some women (up to 10 years), these symptoms can significantly impact quality of life and premature discontinuation of AIs, a beneficial medication. Reishi mushrooms are among several medicinal mushrooms that have been used for hundreds of years, mainly in Asian countries, to help enhance the immune system, reduce stress, improve sleep, and lessen fatigue. Reishi mushroom extracts have not been studied explicitly for treatment-induced arthralgias/myalgias, but have been shown to improve quality of life, muscular strength, pain, and flexibility.

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the addition of an immunotherapy drug (durvalumab) to usual chemotherapy versus usual chemotherapy alone in treating patients with MammaPrint High 2 Risk (MP2) stage II-III hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. There is some evidence from previous clinical trials that people who have a MammaPrint High 2 Risk result may be more likely to respond to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Adding durvalumab to usual chemotherapy may be able to prevent the cancer from returning for patients with MP2 stage II-III hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests how well ARX788 works in treating patients diagnosed with HER2-low, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. ARX788 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is given by infusion (diluted and injected slowly into veins). Antibodies are proteins which are naturally produced by the body's immune system to help fight infections. ARX788 consists of antibodies that have been attached to a toxin that has the potential to kill cancer cells. ARX788 sticks to a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), which is found on some breast cancer cells. Giving ARX788 may be safe and effective in treating patients with HER2-low locally advanced unresectable metastatic breast cancer.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests the effectiveness of cannabidiol (CBD) plant extract (BRC-001) in improving joint stiffness and pain (arthralgia) in women with breast cancer taking aromatase inhibitors (AIs). AIs lower blood levels of estrogen in postmenopausal women to reduce breast cancer recurrence. Women on AI therapy may experience joint stiffness, pain and arthritis symptoms as a side effect of the medication. Some women stop AI therapy due to these side effects and do not receive the maximum benefit from the medication. CBD is derived from the same plant family as marijuana but is not associated with a \"high\" or mind-altering effect and is not habit-forming. Research in animals and humans indicates that CBD might decrease inflammation in joint tissues and may help reduce chronic pain in ailments such as arthritis. BRC-001 may reduce joint pain in women with breast cancer taking AIs.",

This may help keep cancer cells from growing and spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells.
