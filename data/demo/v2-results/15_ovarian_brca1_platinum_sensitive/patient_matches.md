**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
- Patient has a BRCA1 mutation and has received prior treatment with PARP inhibitors.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- The trial requires participants to have high folate receptor alpha (FRα) expression, which is not confirmed in the patient's profile.
- Patient has previously received carboplatin and other therapies, which may conflict with trial's treatment requirements.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Patient's folate receptor alpha (FRα) expression status is unknown.
- Ocular health or history is not provided, which may affect eligibility.

**Assessment:**
> The patient has ovarian cancer and a BRCA1 mutation but lacks confirmation on the required FRα expression for trial eligibility. Additionally, their treatment history raises questions about the treatment line requirements.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Measurable disease status** (per RECIST 1.1) - required for most therapeutic trials
