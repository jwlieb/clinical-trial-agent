      "summary": "The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of your BRCA mutation on the ovaries. The BRCA gene can make it hard to conceive a child in the future. It may also bring on early menopause. The researchers will check blood levels of hormones that the ovaries produce. The hormones that researchers will check are anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The researchers will do this before, during, and after cancer treatment. The researchers will also ask you to fill out questionnaires about your menstrual cycle (your periods) and information about your health and pregnancies. This may help us learn which women will be more likely to have early menopause.",

Premenopausal women age 21-45 with stage 0-3 breast cancer. 2. No prior ovarian surgery or ovarian disease. 3. No prior chemotherapy. 4. Regular menstrual periods (21-35 days), no PCOS. 5. No hormonal contraception within the prior 4 weeks. 6. Mutation testing decision based on NCCN Guidelines V1.2021: according to these Guidelines, both centers test all pre-menopausal women with breast cancer for BRCA and non-BRCA mutations which are the subject of this proposal.\n\n7\\. Receiving an anthracycline (typically doxorubicin/Adriamycin) and Cy (AC)-based chemotherapy protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nFor Cohort of Premenopausal Women with Early Stage Breast Cancer\n\n* Prior therapy for breast cancer or any other cancer, such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or immunotherapy.\n* Ovarian resection, unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or radiation to pelvic region.\n* Plans for risk-reducing bilateral oophorectomy within one year of completion of chemotherapy.\n* Prior known infertility; infertility is defined as one year of inability to conceive despite unprotected intercourse and/or the need to use medication (e.g clomiphene) or assisted reproductive technology (e.g. intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization) to attempt pregnancy.\n* Family history of a first-degree relative with non-surgical menopause \\< age 40\n* Current pregnancy.\n\nSubject Exclusion Criteria:\n\nFor Unaffected High Risk Premenopausal Women with BRCA mutation\n\n1. Participant has therapy for breast cancer or any other cancer, such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or immunotherapy.\n2. Participant has ovarian resection, unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy, radiation to pelvic region.\n3. Participant has Plans for risk-reducing bilateral oophorectomy within one year of completion of chemotherapy.\n4.

Subjects who did not undergo mutation testing, as well as those who tested positive for more than one family (BRCA1, BRCA2, non-BRCA) of ATM-Pathway gene mutations, will be excluded.\n\n2\\. Women aged \\>42 years will be excluded as they carry a very high probability of chemotherapy-induced OI49. It is important to select an age range where immediate OI is less likely to occur because if most women become menopausal post-chemotherapy, the comparison of ovarian reserve decline will not be feasible. 3. In our prior grant period, we showed that the AC-based and CMF regimens similarly compromise ovarian reserve (Fig. 1)9 Currently, the AC-based chemotherapy is utilized in \\>90% breast ca cases, and CMF protocol is rarely administered9. For this reason and to enhance uniformity, rare non-AC-based protocols will be excluded. 4. A previous study showed that smoking and BRCA mutations may have additive negative effects on the age of menopause27, consequently, we will exclude current smokers (smoked 100 cigarettes lifetime and currently smokes, per CDC). Based on our past studies6,9, the smoking incidence is low in our study population (\\<20%) and should not significantly limit accrual.\n\n5\\. BMI: In our recent publication9 (Fig. 1), the mean BMI was 24.22 \u00b10.4 (median 23.2; range 17-42); hence the extreme BMI values are rare in our population. Nevertheless, those with BMI of \\<18.5 and \\>40 will be excluded.",

      "summary": "Background:\n\nThe NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. Researchers want to know if TIL shrink s tumors in people with digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial cancers. In this study, we are selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can cause digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Adults age 18-72 with upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, breast, ovarian/endometrial cancer, or glioblastoma refractory to standard chemotherapy.\n\nDesign:\n\nWork up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed.\n\nSurgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.\n\nLeukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. (Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.)\n\nTreatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.\n\nFollow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.",

The distinct characteristic of the iCaRe2 is its geographical coverage, with a significant percentage of small and rural hospitals and cancer centers. The iCaRe2 advances comprehensive studies of risk factors of cancer development and progression and enables the design of novel strategies for prevention, screening, early detection and personalized treatment of cancer. Centers with expertise in cancer epidemiology, genetics, biology, early detection, and patient care can collaborate by using the iCaRe2 as a platform for cohort and population studies.",

Knowledge of how family history, environmental exposures, and inflammatory lesion of the pancreas contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases is essential.\n\nYou may qualify to take part in this research study because you have inflammation in the pancreas, a pancreatic cyst, pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas, pancreatic cancer, a family history of pancreatic cancer, or a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer.\n\nWe will also be collecting a blood sample from all participants for DNA isolation. Sometimes we are born with genes or DNA that give us an increased or decreased chance of developing an illness later in life. Genetic material will be isolated from your blood for further study. You may also choose to provide additional blood samples for serum and plasma extraction. Serum and plasma are components of the blood which can be used to measure indicators of disease in the blood, called biomarkers,for pancreatic diseases.

The web-based educational intervention includes all of the information typically covered during genetic counseling. As a result, after completing the education intervention, participants can proceed directly to a brief telephone call with a genetic counselor followed by testing if they choose. A baseline survey will be administered prior to randomization and then follow-up surveys will be administered at 1-month and 6-months post-randomization. Primary outcomes will be completion of genetic counseling, uptake of genetic testing, genetic test results and quality of life.",

Olaparib is a drug that blocks an enzyme involved in many cell functions, including the repair of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. Blocking this enzyme may help keep tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. DS-8201a is an antibody-drug conjugate. This agent has two components: an antibody component and a chemotherapy component. The antibody component is attached to the chemotherapy molecules. Upon administration of DS-8201a, the antibody targets and binds to tumor cells that have abundant HER2 (human-epidermal growth factor receptor 2), which is a protein on the surface of some tumor cells. The chemotherapy then enters the cells and blocks DNA replication in the tumor cells with abundant HER2, causing them to die. Giving DS-8201a and olaparib may shrink or stabilize the cancer.",

Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods outlined for women of child-bearing potential if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method\n* Male subjects must not freeze or donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the study period, and at least 4 months after the final study drug administration.

Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with a medical history of myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization/enrollment, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association class IIb to IV), troponin levels consistent with myocardial infarction as defined according to the manufacturer 28 days prior to randomization\n* Patients with a corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation to \\> 470 ms (females) or \\> 450 ms (males) based on average of the screening triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Patients with multiple primary malignancies within 3 years, except adequately resected non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ disease, and other solid tumors curatively treated\n* Patients with an uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals\n* Patients receiving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine will require a washout period of \\>= 14 days to be eligible for the study\n* Patients with unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as toxicities (other than alopecia) not yet resolved to grade =\\< 1 or baseline. Subjects with chronic grade 2 toxicities may be eligible per the discretion of the investigator after consultation with the sponsor medical monitor or designee (e.g., grade 2 chemotherapy-induced neuropathy)\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because DS-8201a is a HER2 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with DS-8201a, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with DS-8201a. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Patients who have received a live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of DS-8201a",

      "summary": "This phase I/Ib trial identifies the side effects and best dose of abemaciclib when given together with olaparib in treating patients with ovarian cancer that responds at first to treatment with drugs that contain the metal platinum but then comes back within a certain period (recurrent platinum-resistant). Abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Adding abemaciclib to olaparib may work better to treat recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",

      "summary": "The study aims to develop a test for early detection of ovarian cancer using DNA from a growth involving the ovary found in a washing of the uterus (womb), and proteins found in the blood. The samples of the wash and the blood will be taken before surgery. After surgery, doctors will determine whether the participant had ovarian cancer or a benign disease of the ovaries. The tests of the washings and the blood will be examined to see how much the participants with ovarian cancer can be separated from the participants with a benign ovarian disease by the tests. Small amounts from the washing and the blood samples will be sent to four sites for analysis.\n\nStatistical analyses of these data will compare tumor DNA found in the washing of the uterus with proteins in the blood to detect cases of ovarian cancer. The primary goal is to find tests that are mostly positive for cases of ovarian cancer and mostly negative for patients with benign disease. It is hoped that if the tests work for participants with symptoms of the disease that these tests will also work when testing women who have no symptoms. A new study would be needed to see if the tests worked in this situation. If the tests work, this could lead to increasing the number of cases detected in early stage disease and decreasing the number of cases detected in late stage disease. If this change in late stage is large, it will likely reduce deaths due to ovarian cancer.",

      "summary": "This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety and cost-effectiveness of opportunistic salpingectomy (OS-the removal of the fallopian tubes) at the time of colorectal surgery to prevent ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is the fifth cause of cancer-related mortality in females in Canada. OS can prevent the most common and lethal type of ovarian cancer, high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). OS during gynecologic surgery (hysterectomy or instead of tubal ligation) is safe and effective. However, rates of hysterectomies and tubal sterilization are decreasing. This research team aims to extend the prevention of ovarian cancer by expanding to offer OS during other surgeries in the pelvis where fallopian tubes are accessible, beginning with colorectal surgery. This study will examine: 1) the feasibility of OS at the time of colorectal surgery; 2) the safety of OS at the time of colorectal surgery; 3) the cost-effectiveness of OS at the time of colorectal surgery.\n\nThe hypothesis is that OS will be well accepted by individuals with fallopian tubes undergoing colorectal surgery, and that the vast majority (around 90 percent) of attempts to remove both fallopian tubes will be successful. It is expected that there will be 10-20 minutes additional operating room time for completing OS and that there will be no increased risk of complications when OS is included in a colorectal surgery. The researchers also hypothesize that OS at the time of colorectal surgery will be cost-effective because of the reduced number of ovarian cancer cases and associated treatment costs.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests whether ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) in combination with talazoparib works to shrink tumors in patients with solid tumors that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with treatment and that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Another aim of this study is to find out if, and how, patients' genes influence their response to this specific drug combination. For this part of the study, investigators will run tests using samples of patients' tumor tissue and blood that will be collected during the study. ZEN-3694 is an inhibitor of a family of proteins called the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET). It may prevent the growth of tumor cells that overproduce BET protein. Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Genes are pieces of the DNA code that individuals inherit from their parents. Some genes work to protect against cancer by correcting damage that can occur in the DNA when cells divide. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two examples of these types of genes, and they are called tumor-suppressor genes. For example, if a person has a mutation in a BRCA1/2 gene they have a greatly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer because their cells may no longer be able to completely repair damaged DNA. It is the accumulation of DNA damage which causes a cell to change into a cancerous cell. Other genes are also involved in this process, and these are called DNA damage repair genes. The KRAS mutation is a change in a protein in normal cells. Normally KRAS serves as an information hub for signals in the cell that lead to cell growth, but when there is a mutation in KRAS it signals too much and cells grow without being told to, which causes cancer. Combination therapy with ZEN-3694 and talazoparib may be effective at slowing or stopping tumor growth in patients with advanced cancer.",

      "summary": "This phase II ComboMATCH treatment trial compares selumetinib plus olaparib to selumetinib alone in women with endometrial or ovarian (fallopian tube and primary peritoneal) cancer that has come back (recurrent) or that remains despite treatment (persistent) and harbors a mutation in the RAS pathway. Selumetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. The addition of olaparib to selumetinib could increase the percentage of tumors that shrink as well as lengthen the time that the tumors remain stable (without progression) as compared to selumetinib alone.",

      "summary": "The purpose of this phase 1 clinical trials is to determine whether niraparib (a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi)) can be safely combined with irinotecan with manageable toxicity and reasonable efficacy. Emerging evidence suggest that PARPi is an effective therapeutic strategy in a wider subset of solid tumors that may have defective homologous recombination (HR) or DNA repair gene mutations. BReast CAncer gene (BRCA), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), and various other DNA repair germline mutations predispose carriers to cancers of the breast, ovaries, pancreas, prostate and melanoma. A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated that PARP inhibitors can work as chemopotentiators. There is significant interest in this combination, and the recommended phase II dose will be used in the upcoming NCI ComboMatch trial.",

      "summary": "This phase I/II trial tests the safety, side effects, best dose, and effectiveness of multi-epitope folate receptor alpha-loaded dendritic cell vaccine (FRalphaDC) with pembrolizumab in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (collectively known as ovarian cancer) that that has come back (after a period of improvement) (recurrent). Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the United States. While the majority of patients achieve a remission from ovarian cancer with the combination of aggressive cytoreductive surgery and cytotoxic chemotherapy, over 80% of patients develop recurrence within 3 years of completion of treatment. Additional treatments are needed for recurrence, but the standard treatment modalities are non-curative in nature due to the development of drug resistance. As such, there is a great unmet need for treatment strategies that utilize new mechanisms to which drug resistance does not develop. FRalphaDC is a dendritic cell vaccine that is made from the white blood cells collected from a procedure call apheresis. The white blood cells are treated to make dendritic cells, which will then be incubated with peptides, which are pieces of a protein known as \"folate receptor alpha\" (FRalpha), a protein that is found in high levels on ovarian cancer cells. Dendritic cell vaccines work by boosting the immune system (a system in the body that protect against infection) to recognize and destroy the tumor cells by targeting the FRalpha protein. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving FRalphaDC vaccine with pembrolizumab may be a safe and effective treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer.",

Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694. Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided. If alternative is not available, the use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is permitted with careful monitoring and approval by study team. At the discretion of the provider, additional monitoring (labs, toxicity checks) may be implemented for use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Substrates of CYP1A2 with narrow therapeutic window also must be avoided white taking ZEN003694. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are Factor Xa inhibitors are discouraged given concerns for thrombocytopenia (i.e., rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban otamixaban, letaxaban, eribaxaban) and Factor IIa inhibitors (i.e., dabigatran).

Olaparib is a polyadenosine 5'-diphosphoribose polymerase (PARP) enzyme inhibitor and may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Giving olaparib for one year with or without bevacizumab may be effective in treating patients with BRCA 1/2 mutated or homologous recombination deficient stage III or IV ovarian cancer, when compared to two years of olaparib.",

FR\u03b1DCs, a dendritic cell vaccine, is made from a person's white blood cells. The white blood cells are treated in the laboratory to make dendritic cells (a type of immune cell) mixed with folate receptor alpha (FRalpha), a protein found in high levels on ovarian tumor cells. FR\u03b1DCs work by boosting the immune system to recognize and destroy the tumor cells by targeting the FRalpha protein on the tumor cell. Placebo is an inactive substance that looks the same as, and is given the same way as, the active drug or treatment being tested. The effects of the active drug are compared to the effects of the placebo.

      "summary": "Background:\n\nMesothelioma is a rare cancer typically caused by exposure to asbestos and related fibers. Most people with mesothelioma survive less than 5 years after diagnosis. About 3000 people in the United States die from this disease each year. People with inherited mutations in the BAP1 gene \\[called BAP1 Cancer Syndrome (BCS)\\] are more likely to develop mesothelioma and other cancers such as melanomas and renal cell carcinomas without asbestos exposure. Almost all people with BCS develop multiple cancers, of which mesothelioma is the most commonly observed.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a study drug (APG-115) in participants with BAP1 Cancer Syndrome (BCS) and early-stage mesothelioma.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 years and older with germline BAP1 mutations and early-stage mesothelioma that does not yet need standard treatment are eligible for protocol enrollment. Participants will be required to also enroll in NIH protocols 20-C-0106 and 06-C-0014 which allow for pre- and post-treatment biopsies and bloodwork to be obtained for additional research studies.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. Their medical records will be reviewed. They will have imaging scans and tests of their heart and lung functions. A procedure using a flexible tube with a camera and light will be inserted into the participant s chest and abdomen through a small cut to look at the tumors and to collect a tissue sample (biopsy).\n\nAPG-115 capsules are taken by mouth. Participants will take the drug at home every other day for the first 13 days of the 21-day treatment cycles.\n\nOn the first day of each cycle, researchers will call or email participants to check on their health.\n\nParticipants will have blood tests 2 times a week during the first 2 cycles; after that, the blood tests will be weekly. These blood tests can be done at a local medical facility or at the NIH Clinical Center.\n\nParticipants may continue treatment for up to 16 cycles.\n\nImaging scans, biopsy, and other tests will be repeated after 8 and 16 cycles.",

      "summary": "A strategy to target the oncogenic receptor HER2 using a version of the anti-HER2 therapeutic antibody trastuzumab coupled to desferrioxamine (DFO) and radiolabeled with zirconium-89 (\\[89Zr\\]-DFO-trastuzumab) has been successfully evaluated in our group in preclinical settings. Clinical studies by other groups in recent years have shown the potential of targeting HER2+ lesions with \\[89Zr\\]-DFO-trastuzumab in patients with HER2+ cancers. We now want to establish the diagnostic potential of a protocol adding \\[89Zr\\]-DFO-trastuzumab PET imaging to FDG PET already used in the clinic for the detection of HER2-expressing cancers, including low expression levels considered until now as HER2-negative (HER2-low, IHC score 1+ and 2+ without FISH amplification of the HER2 locus). The HER2-low status has recently gained relevance thanks to large studies showing the efficacy of immunotherapy combined with drugs such as Enhertu (trastuzumab-deruxtecan), while trastuzumab alone was traditionally only effective for HER2+ cancers (IHC score 2+/FISH+, or 3+). In particular, we aim to develop a method to assess whole-body intertumoral heterogeneity in HER2 expression in order to detect cases with heterogeneous diseases and thus better stage patients and guide the optimal choice of personalized and targeted treatment to use. More specifically, the project aims to image with \\[89Zr\\]-DFO-trastuzumab PET patients with cancer, particularly breast cancer, but also esophageal, gastric, ovarian, endometrial and lung cancer, and whose primary tumor status is HER2-low.",

Brief and low-cost family history-based screening assessments to identify families at high risk for BRCA-associated cancers have been endorsed by national guidelines and public health organizations. Georgia is among the few states to have implemented statewide family history screening for BRCA-associated cancers. Despite its potential, current clinic-based approaches that identify at-risk women are not sustainable and show limited reach. Additionally, uptake of follow-up cancer screening is sub-optimal and solely focuses on women screened as high genetic risk. This trial will adapt the existing family history screening program and then evaluate it's effectiveness for increasing the number and diversity of women who receive a history assessment and subsequent access to risk-based services such as genetic counseling and testing.",
