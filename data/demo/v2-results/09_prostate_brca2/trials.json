Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. However, little is known about the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases in individuals with the above conditions. Knowledge of how family history, environmental exposures, and inflammatory lesion of the pancreas contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases is essential.\n\nYou may qualify to take part in this research study because you have inflammation in the pancreas, a pancreatic cyst, pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas, pancreatic cancer, a family history of pancreatic cancer, or a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer.\n\nWe will also be collecting a blood sample from all participants for DNA isolation. Sometimes we are born with genes or DNA that give us an increased or decreased chance of developing an illness later in life. Genetic material will be isolated from your blood for further study. You may also choose to provide additional blood samples for serum and plasma extraction. Serum and plasma are components of the blood which can be used to measure indicators of disease in the blood, called biomarkers,for pancreatic diseases. Clinical data and biological specimens contained in this study may be used for a wide variety of future related studies to the cause, diagnosis, outcome and treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\nFunds for conducting this research are provided by Mount Sinai.",

Patients at all stages of disease will be welcome to participate in the PROMISE Registry.\n\nParticipants will be recruited \\& screened over a five-year period. Study participants will be asked to provide a saliva sample to be tested for germline cancer risk variants through Color Health. If the results identify a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, an appointment with a genetic counselor from Color Health will be scheduled to discuss the results.\n\nParticipants will complete a baseline demographic survey that includes self-reported health history, family history of cancer and standardized patient reported outcome (PRO) measures.\n\nPROMISE Registry staff will request medical records from the participant's cancer care provider(s) for the purpose of obtaining clinical data.\n\nParticipants will receive bi-annual newsletters offering information on new developments in treatment and research opportunities, including clinical trials, associated with genetic variants.\n\nEligible participants (those with target germline mutations) will be followed every 6 months to obtain updated health records data and patient-reported outcomes data. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 15 years.\n\nThe PROMISE registry will help identify prostate cancer patients with pathogenic variants to learn more about how these variants affect patient outcomes. Ultimately, we hope to help patients learn more about their disease and the treatments that they may derive the most benefit from, including the germline genetic biomarker-based clinical trials they may be eligible for.\n\nFor more information, visit the study website at: prostatecancerpromise.org",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests whether cabozantinib and atezolizumab work to shrink tumors in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer that had spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib and atezolizumab may kill more tumor cells in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.",

      "summary": "The purpose of this phase 1 clinical trials is to determine whether niraparib (a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi)) can be safely combined with irinotecan with manageable toxicity and reasonable efficacy. Emerging evidence suggest that PARPi is an effective therapeutic strategy in a wider subset of solid tumors that may have defective homologous recombination (HR) or DNA repair gene mutations. BReast CAncer gene (BRCA), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), and various other DNA repair germline mutations predispose carriers to cancers of the breast, ovaries, pancreas, prostate and melanoma. A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated that PARP inhibitors can work as chemopotentiators. There is significant interest in this combination, and the recommended phase II dose will be used in the upcoming NCI ComboMatch trial.",

Must be able to take oral medications.\n12. Based on its mechanism of action and pre-clinical findings, irinotecan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Additionally, the effects of niraparib on the developing fetus are unknown. Therefore:\n\n    a. Females of childbearing potential and their male partners are advised to practice a highly effective method of contraception during treatment with niraparib and/or irinotecan and for 180 days following the last dose for females and 90 days following the last dose for males. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless one of the following applies:\n\n    i. Is considered to be permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.\n\n    ii. Is postmenopausal, defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level consistently in the postmenopausal range (30 milli-international units per millilitre (mIU/mL) or higher) may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy; however, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to confirm a postmenopausal state.\n\n    b.

Must agree to use a male condom (and should also be advised of the benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak).\n\n    c. Highly effective contraception is considered to be a method with a \\< 1% per year failure rate. Recommendations for highly effective contraception while taking niraparib include:\n\n    i. Ongoing use of injectable or implantable progesterone.\n\n    ii. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.\n\n    iii. Bilateral tubal occlusion.\n\n    iv. Complete (as opposed to periodic) abstinence\n\n    . v. Male sterilization, with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of absence of sperm in ejaculate.\n13. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.\n14. For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.\n15. Individuals with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For individuals with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study at clinician's discretion and not otherwise stated below.\n2. Prior allergic reaction to PARP inhibitor or irinotecan or their excipients. Prior PARP inhibitor or irinotecan (or topoisomerase 1 inhibitors) use is allowed.\n3.

Nutritional counseling involves being asked to follow a healthy, balanced diet that includes instructions on what kinds of food are better tolerated during radiation and chemoradiation therapy. This trial may help researchers determine if certain diets may improve the anti-cancer effects of radiation therapy and reduce the side-effects of this treatment.

Giving carboplatin before surgery may shrink tumors in patients with high-risk prostate cancer with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations.",

Prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body (localized) is typically treated through surgery or radiotherapy, which for many men is curable. Despite definitive local therapy, cancer that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent) disease develops in 27-53% of men. Often this is detected by measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) without visible evidence of metastatic disease. Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu-prostate specific membrane antigen \\[PSMA\\]-617) is a new small molecule PSMA-targeted radioactive therapy that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult patients with PSMA-positive mCRPC who have been treated with androgen receptor inhibitors and taxane-based chemotherapy. Vorinostat is used to treat various types of cancer that does not get better, gets worse, or comes back during or after treatment with other drugs. Vorinostat is a drug which inhibits the enzyme histone deacetylase and may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving vorinostat and 177Lu-PSMA-617 may kill more tumor cells in in patients with PSMA-low mCRPC.",

SBRT is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position a patient and precisely deliver radiation to tumors in the body (except the brain). The total dose of radiation is divided into smaller doses given over several days. This type of radiation therapy helps spare normal tissue. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumors cells and have fewer side effects. SBRT may work just as well as hypofractionated radiation therapy at treating patients with biochemically recurrent or oligometastatic prostate cancer, but with a shorter treatment time and possibly fewer side effects.",

      "summary": "In advanced metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressing after chemotherapy and androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy 177Lu-PSMA-617 is an effective treatment. 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT is administered with a fixed schedule: 6 treatment cycles, administered every 6 weeks. However, the optimum number of cycles of 177Lu-PSMA in patients who show good response remains unknown. Some patients may benefit from more than 6 cycles of therapy. Additionally, some patients experience a complete or almost complete response before the last cycle. It is unclear whether these patients benefit from the subsequent remaining treatment cycle(s). A treatment holiday period would spare these patients some exposure to the therapy agent and avoid potentially unnecessary toxicity when treatment efficacy is already maximal and additional treatment effect cannot be expected. This randomized phase 2 study compares a group of patients treated with LuPSMA on a flexible and extended dosing schedule including \"treatment holiday\" periods (investigational arm, up to 12 cycles, as described below) to a control group treated with a fixed dosing schedule of 6 treatments cycles maximum administered every 6 weeks. The flexible dosing schedule in the investigational arm will be based on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) response assessments obtained 24h after injection of LuPSMA therapy cycle. The response assessment during treatment holiday period will be based on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) every 12 weeks. Single-time point SPECT/CT dosimetry protocol at every cycle will be performed and will allow to determine the number of cycles that subjects may receive under the study without exceeding the kidney dose threshold.",

The treatment options are dependent on the disease stage, its features, and the patient's condition and preferences. The disease outcome also varies significantly due to the previous heterogeneity of the features in addition to other social determinants of health.\n\nTherefore, it is critical to obtain real-world data that reflects the actual patterns of prostate cancer presentation, work up, management, and outcome. Real World Prostate Cancer Registry (RWPCR) aims at compiling real world data from patients presented with prostate cancer in the tristate area. The data collection will be prospective and longitudinal including patients' demographics and disease characteristics, work up, management, and outcome.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests how well risk based de-escalated hormone therapy (i.e., fewer treatments) with radiation works in treating patients with prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (LHRH) and abiraterone acetate (Zytiga), lower the amount of the male hormone, testosterone, made by the body. This may help kill or stop the growth of tumor cells that need testosterone to grow. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Research has shown that long-term ADT is beneficial for patients with high-risk prostate cancer. However, there are few studies that determine ADT treatment based on risk factors. Giving risk based de-escalated ADT with radiation therapy may be as effective as giving more ADT in treating high-risk prostate cancer.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of adding carboplatin to the standard of care chemotherapy drug cabazitaxel versus cabazitaxel alone in treating prostate cancer that keeps growing even when the amount of testosterone in the body is reduced to very low levels (castrate-resistant) and that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cabazitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Prednisone is often given together with chemotherapy drugs. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs and to help the chemotherapy work. Giving carboplatin with the standard of care chemotherapy drug cabazitaxel may be better at treating metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.",

      "summary": "Lung cancer is responsible for more deaths in the United States than breast, prostate and colon cancer combined and is the number one cancer killer of Veterans. This is because lung cancer is usually diagnosed when the disease has spread, and cure is less likely. Lung cancer screening (LCS) finds cancer at an earlier stage when it is curable, yet only 20% of eligible Veterans have been screened. Uptake is even lower among Black Veterans despite higher lung cancer risk. Using prediction models to identify high-benefit people for whom LCS should be encouraged improves efficiency and reduces disparities. Moreover, it is more patient-centered as shared decision-making conversations can be tailored with personalized information. The US Preventive Services Task Force has called for research to demonstrate that prediction-augmented LCS can be feasibly implemented at the point-of-care. The investigators propose for VA to lead this effort with a large-scale pragmatic clinical trial to show that prediction-augmented LCS is both feasible and improves LCS uptake.",

An MCD test measures markers in the blood in order to screen for multiple cancers simultaneously. There is a need to understand how MCDs may work as cancer screening tools. The goal of cancer screening is to reduce the burden of cancer by identifying cancers before they show symptoms or signs, when treatment is likely to be most effective. In this study, adults aged 45-75 without cancer will be randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: 2 separate MCD test groups or a control group. These two MCD tests will not be compared to each other but will be compared to cancers detected in the control group. This study will provide early information on how well MCD tests perform as cancer screening tools. It will also help researchers understand how patients and their doctors make decisions about their care when the MCD test result comes back as normal (negative) or abnormal (positive).",
