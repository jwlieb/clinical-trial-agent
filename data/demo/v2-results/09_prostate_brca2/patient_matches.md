### [NCT06216249](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06216249)

**A Phase 2 Randomized Trial in Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer to Determine the Efficacy of a Flexible Dosing Schedule of Lu-PSMA Treatment up to 12 Cycles Including Potential Treatment Holiday Periods in Comparison to the Standard Fixed Dosing Schedule of Six Cycles Every Six Weeks (FLEX-MRT)**

- **Sponsor**: Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center
- **Phase**: Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 75%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age: 72 (adult eligibility)
- ECOG status: 1
- Received at least one regimen of chemotherapy for mCRPC (docetaxel)
- Received at least one androgen-receptor signaling inhibitor (enzalutamide)
- Histopathology confirmed prostate cancer
- No brain metastases
- PSA response to prior treatment with olaparib

**? Uncertainties:**
- WBC, PLT, Hb, ANC values are not provided
- PSMA PET/CT eligibility is uncertain as it has not been stated if the patient underwent this within 8 weeks of planned first cycle.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial's indication of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The patient has had prior treatments that align with the trial's requirements. However, the confirmation of PSMA PET/CT and certain lab values are missing, leading to a moderate level of confidence in the overall eligibility.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Life expectancy estimate** - many trials require ≥3 months
- **Cardiac status/QTc interval** - relevant for trials with cardiotoxicity risk
