Previously treated with BR (bendamustine/rituximab) x6 cycles, then ibrutinib x3 years with eventual progression. Venetoclax initiated but discontinued after 4 months due to tumor lysis syndrome requiring hospitalization. Now with progressive lymphadenopathy and cytopenias (ANC 0.8, Hgb 8.9, Plt 67k).
