Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as blinatumomab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Ponatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving blinatumomab, methotrexate, cytarabine, and ponatinib may work better in treating patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient, they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated stem cells may also replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells.",

      "summary": "This phase II clinical trial evaluates whether a modified modality of conditioning reduces treatment-related mortality (TRM) in patients who undergo a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for a hematological malignancy. HSCT is a curative therapy for many hematopoietic malignancies, however this regimen results in higher rates of TRM than other forms of treatment. In recent years, less intense conditioning regimens with radiation and chemotherapy prior to HSCT have been developed. Radiation therapy uses high energy sources to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors while chemotherapy drugs like fludarabine and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This study evaluates whether a two-step approach with lower-intensity regimens of these treatments prior to HSCT reduces the rate of TRM.",

Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis), which are used to treat blood cancers, may also negatively affect a person s response to certain vaccines. Researchers want to learn more about vaccine responses in people with certain types of blood cancers. The findings may help develop better vaccine strategies for people with these cancers.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn how well vaccines work in people who have certain types of blood cancers.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 years or older who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, or certain non-Hodgkin lymphomas.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will get one or more vaccines for illnesses such as COVID-19, hepatitis B, and shingles. They can choose which vaccines they receive. They will give a blood sample before they get each vaccine. Some vaccines require a second dose 3-6 weeks later. Participants may give an optional blood sample with the second vaccine dose. About 4 weeks after they finish each vaccine series, they will give another blood sample. They will have 2-3 study visits per vaccine.\n\nParticipants may receive a booster dose for some vaccines. The booster dose is optional. They will give another blood sample with the booster dose.\n\nParticipants will have pregnancy tests, if needed.\n\nParticipants with CLL who receive BTKis may be asked to pause treatment for up to 7 weeks.\n\nParticipants may give follow-up blood samples up to 2 times a year for 5 years. These blood samples are optional.\n\nParticipation will last for up to 5 years after each vaccine series is received.",

Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Obinutuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving acalabrutinib in combination with venetoclax or obinutuzumab may help ease symptoms, decrease the amount of cancer suggestive of improvement, prolonged disease-free remission and/or survival, and increased knowledge about cancer treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients will be treated with acalabrutinib for 12 cycles, and then randomized to receive 6 cycles of acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab or acalabrutinib plus venetoclax.",

The investigating lab developed a pulse method combining multiple stable isotopes to study multiple metabolic pathways in the same individual simultaneously. By measuring whole-body metabolism in a large group of older adults, the investigators may be able to unravel age-related deterioration in protein turnover (synthesis and breakdown) that contributes to impaired functional capacity. Metabolic profiles could explain differences in pathways in the aging process with special interest in metabolism of amino acids as they have been associated with aging-related disorders.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests how well zanubrutinib and lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) work together in treating patients with Richter's syndrome. Richter's syndrome occurs when chronic lymphocytic leukemia and/or small lymphocytic leukemia transforms into an aggressive lymphoma, which is a cancer of the lymph nodes. Zanubrutinib is a class of medication called a kinase inhibitor. These drugs work by preventing the action of abnormal proteins that tell cancer cells to multiply, which helps stop the spread of cancer. Liso-cel is a type of treatment known as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Giving zanubrutinib and liso-cell together may kill more cancer cells in patients with Richter's syndrome.",

Giving the CMV-MVA triplex vaccine to donors may help prevent CMV infection of patients undergoing stem cell transplantation.",

Pirtobrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the a protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking BCL-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Giving pirtobrutinib and venetoclax may kill more cancer cells in patients with CLL or SLL that is resistant to covalent BTKi.",

The researchers central hypothesis is that a high EAA to NEAA ratio in a protein meal is related to higher anabolic response to the meal. The researchers also hypothesize that the type of NEAA in a protein meal also affects the anabolic capacity of the meal. The researchers rationale is that finding the amino acid composition of a meal that will maximally induce protein anabolism will guide novel nutritional approaches to prevent and treat sarcopenia, thereby reducing both overall economic burden and improving individual patient outcomes.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial studies the side effects of an escalated ramp-up of sonrotoclax following initial debulking with zanubrutinib or rituximab in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) that is newly diagnosed, has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B-cells, and may kill tumor cells. Zanubrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking a protein called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is needed for tumor cell growth. Sonrotoclax works by blocking a protein called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2). This protein helps certain types of blood tumor cells to survive and grow. When sonrotoclax blocks Bcl-2 it slows down or stops the growth of tumor cells and helps them die. Giving an increased dose of sonrotoclax over a shorter period of time in combination with zanubrutinib or rituximab may be safe and tolerable in treating patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory CLL, SLL, and MCL.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests how well nemtabrutinib in combination with pembrolizumab works in treating patients with Richter transformation, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtype (RT-DLBCL). Nemtabrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It blocks a protein called BTK, which is present on B-cells (a type of white blood cell) in cancers such as Richter transformation at abnormal levels. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving nemtabrutinib in combination with pembrolizumab may kill more cancer cells in patients with RT-DLBCL.",
