Completed FOLFIRINOX x8 cycles with stable disease, then switched to gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel due to neuropathy. Now with radiographic progression and rising CA19-9 (2400 -> 8500). Moderate abdominal discomfort, using long-acting opioids. Nutrition supported with pancreatic enzyme replacement. Weight stable past 4 weeks. Seeking novel KRAS-targeted approaches including G12D-specific inhibitors."
