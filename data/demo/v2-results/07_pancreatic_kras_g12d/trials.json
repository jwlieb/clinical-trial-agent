Specifically, the quantitative computer aided detection of lung CT abnormalities from LAM can be compared to assess whether low radiation dose CT exams is an alternative to conventional CT to monitor disease\n\nstatus.\n\nThis optional sub-study will be offered to up to 100 adult subjects with lung disease and up to 50 children age 9 and older with CF. Children will not be enrolled in the optional CT sub-study unless they have had a standard CT scan for medical purposes to use in comparison. One additional low dose radiation CT scan of the chest may be done as part of this sub-study when these subjects have their next annual CT scan.",

      "summary": "Background:\n\nThe NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. Researchers want to know if TIL shrink s tumors in people with digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial cancers. In this study, we are selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can cause digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Adults age 18-72 with upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, breast, ovarian/endometrial cancer, or glioblastoma refractory to standard chemotherapy.\n\nDesign:\n\nWork up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed.\n\nSurgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.\n\nLeukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. (Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.)\n\nTreatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.\n\nFollow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.",

We also hope to learn the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.\n\nIn this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor cells.\n\nInvestigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor.

      "summary": "Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are a common incidental finding in cross sectional imaging (up to 27% on CT scan and 41% on MRI) and pose a management challenge to physicians. According to society guidelines, PCLs with specific features should prompt additional workup with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for cyst characterization as well as cyst sampling. This can help determine if the cyst is mucinous or non-mucinous which has implications for its malignant potential. Cyst fluid has traditionally been sampled using EUS with fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and sent for fluid analysis and cytology. More recently, the adjunctive use of the through-the-scope micro forceps (Moray micro forceps, US Endoscopy, Mentor, OH) biopsy (EUS-MFB) has shown promise for diagnosis of PCLs. This technology utilizes a micro forceps through a 19-gauge needle to biopsy the cyst wall for histology, in addition to collecting cyst fluid for CEA level and cytology. More recently, the adjunctive use of the Moray\u00ae through the needle micro forceps biopsy (EUS-MFB) has shown promise for diagnosis of PCLs. This technology utilizes a micro forceps through a 19-gauge needle to biopsy the cyst wall for histology, in addition to collecting cyst fluid for CEA level and cytology. Only a few small retrospective reports have been published regarding the use of MFB. The results of this study will hopefully help increase diagnostic yield by obtaining a histopathologic diagnosis of these PCLs, and potentially affect practice patterns of gastroenterologists and the endoscopic community, specifically those physicians who perform EUS in these patients. Furthermore, the results will help determine whether there is reason to continue this line of research to obtain a definite histologic tissue diagnosis of PCLs.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial studies the effects of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab maintenance therapy in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced) and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Lenvatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving lenvatinib and pembrolizumab may be effective as a maintenance therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.",

Any medical problems will be recorded at each dose. This is done to find suitable doses of ASP3082, by itself or together with cetuximab, to use in Part 2 of the study. The first group will receive the lowest dose of ASP3082. A medical expert panel will check the results from this group and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP3082. The panel will do this for each group until all groups have received ASP3082 (by itself or together with cetuximab) or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.\n\nIn Part 2, ASP3082 will be given in by itself, or in combination with the other study treatments.\n\nStudy treatments will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each treatment cycle is 21 or 28 days long. They will continue treatment until: they have medical problems from the treatment they can't tolerate; their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; or they ask to stop treatment.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as zimberelimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Quemliclustat acts as a blocker for adenosine. Adenosine is a chemical produced in the body that can lead to a decrease in the immune system's response towards cancer. Quemliclustat has the potential to decrease the amount of adenosine, allowing the immune system to recognize and act against the cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy in combination with zimberelimab and quemliclustat may kill more cancer cells than chemotherapy alone.",

      "summary": "The purpose of this phase 1 clinical trials is to determine whether niraparib (a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi)) can be safely combined with irinotecan with manageable toxicity and reasonable efficacy. Emerging evidence suggest that PARPi is an effective therapeutic strategy in a wider subset of solid tumors that may have defective homologous recombination (HR) or DNA repair gene mutations. BReast CAncer gene (BRCA), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), and various other DNA repair germline mutations predispose carriers to cancers of the breast, ovaries, pancreas, prostate and melanoma. A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated that PARP inhibitors can work as chemopotentiators. There is significant interest in this combination, and the recommended phase II dose will be used in the upcoming NCI ComboMatch trial.",

Must be able to take oral medications.\n12. Based on its mechanism of action and pre-clinical findings, irinotecan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Additionally, the effects of niraparib on the developing fetus are unknown. Therefore:\n\n    a. Females of childbearing potential and their male partners are advised to practice a highly effective method of contraception during treatment with niraparib and/or irinotecan and for 180 days following the last dose for females and 90 days following the last dose for males. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless one of the following applies:\n\n    i. Is considered to be permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.\n\n    ii. Is postmenopausal, defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level consistently in the postmenopausal range (30 milli-international units per millilitre (mIU/mL) or higher) may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy; however, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to confirm a postmenopausal state.\n\n    b. A male participant of reproductive potential is eligible to participate if he agrees to the following starting with the first dose of study treatment through at least 90 days (a spermatogenesis cycle) after the last dose of study treatment:\n\n    i. refrain from donating sperm.\n\n    ii. Must agree to use a male condom (and should also be advised of the benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak).\n\n    c. Highly effective contraception is considered to be a method with a \\< 1% per year failure rate. Recommendations for highly effective contraception while taking niraparib include:\n\n    i. Ongoing use of injectable or implantable progesterone.\n\n    ii. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.\n\n    iii. Bilateral tubal occlusion.\n\n    iv. Complete (as opposed to periodic) abstinence\n\n    . v. Male sterilization, with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of absence of sperm in ejaculate.\n13. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.\n14. For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.\n15. Individuals with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For individuals with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study at clinician's discretion and not otherwise stated below.\n2. Prior allergic reaction to PARP inhibitor or irinotecan or their excipients. Prior PARP inhibitor or irinotecan (or topoisomerase 1 inhibitors) use is allowed.\n3.

Patients may not currently receive steroids for their brain metastases. Patients with small, asymptomatic brain metastases (\\<1cm) may enroll.\n7. Individuals with a second primary malignancy\n8. Individuals with a prior history of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)\n9. Individuals with systolic blood pressure \\>140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\>90 mmHg that has not been adequately treated or controlled\n10. History of a malabsorption syndrome or uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that may interfere with the absorption of oral study medication in the opinion of the investigator.\n11. Known or suspected diagnosis of Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or Acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n12. Known Gilbert's disease\n13. Individuals who are pregnant and/or breast feeding, or expecting to conceive children while receiving study treatment and/or for up to 180 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n14.

      "summary": "This clinical trial is studying advanced solid tumors. Solid tumors are cancers that start in a part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once tumors have grown bigger in one place but haven't spread, they're called locally advanced. If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body, it's called metastatic. When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.\n\nParticipants in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment. Participants must have a solid tumor cancer that can't be treated with standard of care drugs.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called PF-08046050. PF-08046050 is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.\n\nThis study will test the safety of PF-08046050 in participants with solid tumors that are hard to treat or have spread throughout the body.\n\nThis study has 5 different study parts. Part A and Part B of the study will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if PF-08046050 is safe and if it works to treat certain solid tumor cancers. Part D and E of the study, together with information from Parts A and B, will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Part E will use the information from Parts A, B, and D to see if PF-08046050 is safe in combination with other anti-cancer agents and if it works to treat a certain solid tumor.",

      "summary": "Genes contain genetic code which tell the body which proteins to make. Some types of cancer are caused by changes, or mutations, in a gene called KRAS. Researchers are looking for ways to stop the actions of abnormal proteins made from the mutated KRAS gene. The so-called G12D mutation in the KRAS gene is common in people with some solid tumors.\n\nASP4396 is being developed as a potential new treatment for solid tumors in people who have the G12D mutation in their KRAS gene. ASP4396 is not currently available as a treatment for the public. In this study, researchers will learn how ASP4396 is processed by and acts upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose and to check for potential medical problems from ASP4396.\n\nIn this study, ASP4396 is being given to humans for the first time.\n\nPeople in this study will be adults with locally advanced (unresectable), or metastatic solid tumors with the G12D mutation in their KRAS gene. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. They may have been previously treated with standard therapies or refused to receive those treatments.\n\nThe main aims of the study are to check the safety of ASP4396, how well people cope with medical problems during the study (how well it is tolerated), and to find a suitable dose of ASP4396.\n\nThis is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that they will receive ASP4396.\n\nThis study will be in 2 parts.\n\nPart 1 is called Dose Escalation. Different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of ASP4396. For each dose, all medical problems will be recorded. The first group will receive the lowest dose of ASP4396. A medical expert panel will check the results and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP4396. The panel will do this until all groups have taken ASP4396 or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.\n\nPart 2 is called Dose Expansion. Other different small groups of people will receive ASP4396 with the most suitable doses worked out from Part 1. This will help find a more accurate dose of ASP4396 to use in future studies.\n\nIn both parts of the study, ASP4396 will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each treatment cycle is 21 days long. People will continue treatment until: they have medical problems from the treatment they can't cope with (can't tolerate); their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; or they ask to stop treatment.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic on certain days during their treatment, with extra visits during the first 2 cycles of treatment. The study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP4396. Also, people in the study will have a health check including blood tests. On some visits they will also have scans to check for any changes in their cancer. Tumor samples will be taken at certain visits during treatment with the option of a tumor sample being taken after treatment has finished.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic about 7 days after they stop treatment. They will be asked about any medical problems and will have a health check including blood tests.\n\nAfter this, people will visit the clinic for a health check several times. The number of visits and checks done at each visit will depend on the health of each person and whether they completed their treatment or not.\n\nAfter treatment has finished, people in the study will be followed up for up to 45 weeks.",

Irinotecan is in a class of antineoplastic medications called topoisomerase I inhibitors. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair and may kill tumor cells. Liposomal irinotecan is a form of the anticancer drug irinotecan that is contained inside very tiny, fat-like particles. Liposomal irinotecan may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of the drug. Oxaliplatin is in a class of medications called platinum-containing antineoplastic agents. It damages the cell's DNA and may kill tumor cells. 5-fluorouracil, a type of antimetabolite, stops cells from making DNA and it may kill tumor cells. Leucovorin, a form of folic acid, is used to lessen the toxic effects of substances that block the action of folic acid. It is a type of chemoprotective agent and a type of chemosensitizing agent. Giving NALIRIFOX before surgery may improve the chance of successful surgery and decrease the chance of the cancer returning after surgery in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.",

      "summary": "The Vanguard Study is a feasibility study to explore several aspects of evaluating multi-cancer detection (MCD) tests in a future definitive randomized controlled trial. An MCD test measures markers in the blood in order to screen for multiple cancers simultaneously. There is a need to understand how MCDs may work as cancer screening tools. The goal of cancer screening is to reduce the burden of cancer by identifying cancers before they show symptoms or signs, when treatment is likely to be most effective. In this study, adults aged 45-75 without cancer will be randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: 2 separate MCD test groups or a control group. These two MCD tests will not be compared to each other but will be compared to cancers detected in the control group. This study will provide early information on how well MCD tests perform as cancer screening tools. It will also help researchers understand how patients and their doctors make decisions about their care when the MCD test result comes back as normal (negative) or abnormal (positive).",

This is an open-label study which means that participants and study staff will know that all participants will receive ARV-806.\n\nResearchers think that ARV-806 can work by breaking down a specific protein with a mutation that is present in some tumors, which might help prevent or slow tumors from growing. This will be the first time ARV-806 will be used in people. The investigational drug will be given through a vein. This is called intravenous (IV) infusion.\n\nThis study will include 2 parts.\n\nIn Part A (Phase 1), different small groups of participants will receive lower to higher doses of ARV-806. Adults with advanced cancers having a specific KRAS mutation will be included.\n\nIn Part B (Phase 2), participants will be assigned to receive one of up to 2 dose levels decided by the information from Part A. Part B will include participants with advanced pancreatic ductal cancer having a specific KRAS mutation.",

After surgery, they will be given standard chemotherapy treatments chosen by their study doctor.

      "summary": "Genes contain genetic code which tell the body which proteins to make. Many types of cancer are caused by changes, or mutations, in a gene called KRAS. Researchers are looking for ways to stop the actions of abnormal proteins made from the mutated KRAS gene.\n\nASP5834 is being studied in people with solid tumors who have certain KRAS gene mutations. Some people with solid tumors of the colon or rectum (colorectal cancer), will be given ASP5834 with panitumumab. Panitumumab is a treatment for colorectal cancer. In this study, the researchers will learn how ASP5834 is processed by and acts upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose of ASP5834 and check for any potential medical problems from the treatment.\n\nThe main aims of this study are to check the safety of ASP5834 given by itself or given with panitumumab, and how well it is tolerated; and to find a suitable dose of ASP5834 given by itself or given with panitumumab.\n\nPeople in this study will be adults with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumors with certain KRAS gene mutations. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The key reasons people cannot take part are if they have specific uncontrollable cancers such as symptomatic or untreated cancers in nervous system, or have a specific heart condition, or infections.\n\nIn this study, ASP5834 is being given to humans for the first time. This is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that they will receive ASP5834 by itself or ASP5834 with panitumumab.\n\nThis study will be in 2 parts:\n\nPart 1 is called Dose Escalation. Different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of either: ASP5834 by itself or ASP5834 with panitumumab. Only people who have colorectal cancer will receive ASP5834 with panitumumab. People with any type of solid tumor will receive ASP5834 by itself. For each dose, all medical problems will be recorded. A medical expert panel will check the results and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP5834. The panel will do this until the planned maximum number of people are treated or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.\n\nPart 2 is called Dose Expansion. Other different small groups of people will receive ASP5834 or ASP5834 with panitumumab. They will receive the most suitable doses worked out from Part 1.\n\nIn both parts of the study, the study treatments ASP5834 and panitumumab will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each study treatment cycle is either 21 days or 28 days long. People will continue study treatment until: they have medical problems from the study treatment they can't tolerate; their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; or they ask to stop study treatment.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic on certain days during their study treatment, with extra visits during the first 2 cycles of study treatment. The study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP5834. Also, people in the study will have a health check. On some visits they will also have scans to check for any changes in their cancer. Tumor samples will be taken at certain visits during study treatment with the option of a tumor sample being taken if people's cancer gets worse or the cancer comes back.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic shortly after stopping treatment for a health check. After this, people will have health checks every couple of months to check the condition of their cancer. The number of visits and checks done will depend on the health of each person and whether they completed their study treatment or not. It is expected that people will be in this study for about 1 year.",

PET is an established imaging technique that utilizes small amounts of radioactivity attached to very minimal amounts of tracer, in the case of this research, 68Ga-FAPi-46. Because some cancers take up 68Ga-FAPi-46, it can be seen with PET. CT utilizes x-rays that traverse the body from the outside. CT images provide an exact outline of organs and potential inflammatory tissue where it occurs in a patient's body. Combining a PET scan with a CT scan can help make the image easier to interpret. PET/CT scans are hybrid scanners that combine both modalities into a single scan during the same examination.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the effect of time-restricted eating (TRE) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists (RA), semaglutide and tirzepatide, to an American Heart Association (AHA) heart healthy diet (HHD) intervention on heart and blood vessel health (cardiovascular system) and how the body processes food for energy (metabolic system) in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Prostate cancer patients who are receiving hormonal therapy (ADT) are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This is thought to be due to treatment-related metabolic changes which may result in increased weight, body fat, insulin resistance and an increased risk of heart attack, stroke or other heart and blood vessel problems. TRE (also known as intermittent fasting) is an eating plan that alternates between fasting and non-fasting periods. This approach limits calorie intake to a specific window of time each day. GLP1-RAs, semaglutide and tirzepatide are in a class of medications called incretin mimetics. They work by helping the pancreas to release the right amount of insulin when blood sugar levels are high. Insulin helps move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. They also slow the movement of food through the stomach and may decrease appetite and cause weight loss. The AHA HHD guidelines may be an effective method to help people learn about following a heart healthy eating plan. This may lower their risk of cardiovascular disease. Metabolic interventions, TRE and GLP1-RA, may be more effective than an AHA HHD intervention alone in improving cardiovascular and metabolic health in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT.",

      "summary": "The researchers are doing this study to see how well a type of ultrasound imaging called multiparametric ultrasound (mpUS), can be used to examine, evaluate, and provide information about different cancerous and non-cancerous tissue. The researchers will compare the results of mpUS imaging to standard ultrasound imaging and other standard tests.\n\nmpUS imaging is a type of ultrasound imaging that combines different ultrasound methods and analysis to create a more detailed and accurate assessment of tissue. Standard ultrasound provides a basic image of tissue structure, but mpUS imaging can also show blood vessels, blood flow, and detailed tissue structure (microstructure). The researchers think that mpUS may be a better way for evaluating cancer because it combines different ultrasound methods to assess tissue.",
