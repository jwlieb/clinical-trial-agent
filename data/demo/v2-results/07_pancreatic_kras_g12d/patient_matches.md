### [NCT06922591](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06922591)

**A Phase 1/2, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability & Antitumor Activity of TNG462 in Combination With Other Agents in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer With MTAP Loss and Pancreatic or Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With MTAP Loss & RAS Mutation**

- **Sponsor**: Tango Therapeutics, Inc.
- **Phase**: Phase 1/Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 80%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**

- Adequate organ function is not specified

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type (pancreatic cancer) matches the trial's indication, and he has previously received standard therapy, which is compatible with the trial's eligibility. There are some uncertainties regarding the loss of MTAP, measurable disease, and organ function, but overall he appears eligible.

### [NCT03257033](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03257033)

**Targeted Intra-arterial Gemcitabine vs. Continuation of IV Gemcitabine Plus Nab-Paclitaxel Following Induction With Sequential IV Gemcitabine Plus Nab-Paclitaxel and Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer**

- **Sponsor**: RenovoRx
- **Phase**: Phase 3
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 75%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
- ECOG status is 1.
- Patient is over 18 years old.
- No brain metastases present.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient does not meet exclusion criteria for prior treatment as they have received multiple lines of therapy.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Adequate laboratory values are not provided (e.g., ANC, platelet count, hemoglobin, creatinine, AST, ALT, bilirubin levels).

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial criteria as he has locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Although he has had prior therapy, the trial does not explicitly state it is only for treatment-naive patients, so he may still qualify under the prior treatment criteria. However, lab values are missing, which introduces some uncertainty.

## 🟡 MEDIUM Likelihood (1 trials)

### [NCT07033689](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07033689)

**Open-label, Non-randomized, Single-center Study Investigating the Feasibility, Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Suizenji in Unresectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Patients**

- **Sponsor**: SONIRE Therapeutics Inc.
- **Phase**: Early Phase 1
- **Status**: Not yet recruiting
- **Confidence**: 50%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient is 67 years old and meets the age requirement (≥ 18 years)
- Patient has histologically diagnosed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
- Patient has an ECOG Performance Status of 1
- Patient has locally advanced disease, which is considered unresectable
- Patient has adequate life expectancy of ≥ 3 months
- Patient has no brain metastases

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has prior systemic therapy (FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel), which contradicts eligibility criterion requiring newly diagnosed unresectable disease without prior therapies.
- The primary tumor site must be accessible to HIFU treatment and visualized on transabdominal ultrasonography, which is not confirmed in patient data.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Exact organ function lab results (neutrophils, platelets, hemoglobin, creatinine, AST, ALT, bilirubin) are not provided and must be confirmed to check for adequate organ function.
- The requirement regarding the accessibility of the primary tumor to HIFU treatment is unclear.

**Assessment:**
> The patient has a match for the disease type since they have diagnosed PDAC. However, they are not treatment-naive due to previous therapies, which does not align with the trial criteria for newly diagnosed unresectable disease. Additionally, there is uncertainty related to organ function and tumor accessibility for treatment.

## 🟠 LOW Likelihood (1 trials)

### [NCT03551951](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03551951)

**Tumor Cell and DNA Detection in the Blood, Urine and Bone Marrow of Patients With Solid Cancers and Subjects Undergoing Lung Cancer Screening**

- **Sponsor**: University of Missouri-Columbia
- **Phase**: N/A
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 30%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, which is included in the trial conditions.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has prior systemic therapies (FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel) which indicates they are not treatment-naive, but the trial's treatment line is unclear.

**? Uncertainties:**
- It is unclear from the trial description whether it is specifically aimed at first-line or subsequent treatments.

**Assessment:**
> The patient has pancreatic cancer, which matches the trial's condition. However, the presence of prior therapies creates uncertainty about their eligibility regarding treatment lines. The trial's stance on treatment-naive versus previously treated patients remains ambiguous, thus leading to a determination of LOW match likelihood.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Measurable disease status** (per RECIST 1.1) - required for most therapeutic trials
- **Cardiac status/QTc interval** - relevant for trials with cardiotoxicity risk
