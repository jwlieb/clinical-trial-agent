First-line ipilimumab/nivolumab x4 induction then nivolumab maintenance - initial PR but progressed at 14 months. Second-line cabozantinib with mixed response, discontinued for grade 3 hand-foot syndrome and fatigue. Switched to lenvatinib/everolimus - progression at 6 months with new pulmonary and hepatic metastases. IMDC intermediate risk. Seeking novel approaches beyond standard IO/TKI combinations. HIF-2\u03b1 inhibitors of interest. Labs show mild hyperbilirubinemia (1.4), otherwise WNL."
