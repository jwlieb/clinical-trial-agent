### [NCT04989959](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04989959)

**An Exploratory Study of [18F]PT2385 PET/CT in Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma**

- **Sponsor**: Orhan Kemal Oz
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 66%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, which is a condition being studied in the trial.
- Patient has VHL loss, making her potentially eligible for cohort 2.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient is previously treated, having undergone multiple therapies, whereas trial details suggest a potential focus on treatment-naive patients or specific cohorts requiring prior treatment.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Need verification on whether the trial has specific requirements regarding prior therapies for cohort 2.
- More information is needed to determine eligibility concerning the biopsy requirement for cohort 2.

**Assessment:**

- Patient has renal cell carcinoma, but the trial is limited to patients with bone metastases, and no indication of bone metastases is provided.
- Patient was previously treated with multiple therapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors, while the trial requires 1-3 prior therapies with at least one being an IO therapy without prior treatment with zanzalintinib.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Presence and number of bone metastases which are required for inclusion
- Adequate organ function lab results are not provided

**Assessment:**
> While the patient's age and ECOG status meet some criteria, critical requirements regarding the presence of bone metastases and the treatment prior to the trial are not satisfied, leading to exclusion. Additionally, uncertainties regarding organ function and metastatic status further hinder eligibility assessment.

- ECOG status: 1
- Prior therapies: ipilimumab, nivolumab, cabozantinib, lenvatinib, everolimus
- Brain metastases: none
- Co-mutations: VHL loss
- Country: United States

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has received prior treatment with cabozantinib, which is a VEGF-directed agent. This conflicts with inclusion criteria for cohort 1 which states that participants must not have received treatment containing a VEGF-directed agent.
- Patient has also received lenvatinib, which is another VEGF-directed agent, further confirming exclusion from cohort 1.
- Patient has progressed on previous treatments, but the trial may require those who have not received certain types of previous treatments for cohort eligibility.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial's indication of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. However, the patient has received prior treatment containing VEGF-directed agents, specifically cabozantinib and lenvatinib, which conflicts with the inclusion criteria for cohort 1, leading to exclusion.

| [NCT05536141](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05536141) | Arcus Biosciences, I | Patient has prior treatment with multiple therapies including cabozantinib and the trial excludes prior treatment with HIF-2α inhibitors and cabozantinib. |
| [NCT06966024](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06966024) | Deciphera Pharmaceut | Patient has received multiple prior systemic therapies, which may exceed trial's exclusion of previous anticancer therapy. |

| [NCT04981509](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04981509) | National Cancer Inst | Patient has renal cell carcinoma (RCC) which is not a match for the trial that is specifically studying hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) or sporadic papillary renal cell carcinoma. |
| [NCT05641935](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05641935) | john eisenbrey | Patient has renal cell carcinoma, but the trial specifically requires patients who have previously received cryotherapy or microwave therapy, which the patient has not. |

| [NCT06500455](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06500455) | NRG Oncology | Patient has no intact brain metastases; the trial requires at least 1 intact brain metastasis. |
| [NCT00102544](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00102544) | National Institutes  | Patient has renal cell carcinoma but trial mainly studies adenocarcinoma and prostate neoplasms, with renal cell carcinoma indicated but not the primary focus. |

| [NCT06447103](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06447103) | Jonsson Comprehensiv | Patient has metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), while trial is for detecting recurrent ccRCC after surgery. |

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Measurable disease status** (per RECIST 1.1) - required for most therapeutic trials
- **Life expectancy estimate** - many trials require ≥3 months
