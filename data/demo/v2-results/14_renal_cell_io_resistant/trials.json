BHD is a rare inherited condition characterized by papules, or bumps-benign tumors involving hair follicles-on the head and neck. People with BHD are at increased risk of developing kidney cancer. Scientists have identified the chromosome (strand of genetic material in the cell nucleus) that contains the BHD gene and the region of the gene on the chromosome. This study will try to learn more about:\n\n* The characteristics and type of kidney tumors associated with BHD\n* The risk of kidney cancer in people with BHD\n* Whether more than one gene causes BHD\n* The genetic mutations (changes) responsible for BHD\n\nPatients with known or suspected Birt Hogg-Dube syndrome, and their family members, may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a family history and review of medical records, including pathology reports for tumors, and films of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\n\nParticipants may undergo various tests and procedures, including the following:\n\n* Physical examination\n* Review of personal and family history with a cancer doctor, cancer nurses, kidney surgeon, and genetic counselor\n* Chest and other x-rays\n* Ultrasound (imaging study using sound waves)\n* MRI (imaging study using radiowaves and a magnetic field)\n* CT scans of the chest and abdomen (imaging studies using radiation)\n* Blood tests for blood chemistries and genetic testing\n* Skin evaluation, including a skin biopsy (surgical removal of a small skin tissue sample for microscopic evaluation)\n* Cheek swab or mouthwash to collect cells for genetic analysis\n* Lung function studies\n* Medical photography of skin lesions\n\nThese tests will be done on an outpatient basis in either one day or over 3 to 4 days. When the studies are complete, participants will receive counseling about the findings and recommendations. Patients with kidney lesions may be asked to return periodically, such as every 3 to 36 months, based on their individual condition, to document the rate of progression of the lesions.",

      "summary": "This study will evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of an experimental tracking device for locating abnormalities during invasive procedures, such as biopsy or ablation, that cannot easily be visualized by usual imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) scans or ultrasound. Some lesions, such as certain liver or kidney tumors, small endocrine abnormalities, and others, may be hard to find or only visible for a few seconds. The new method uses a needle with a miniature tracking device buried inside the metal that tells where the tip of the needle is located, somewhat like a mini GPS, or global positioning system. It uses a very weak magnet to localize the device like a miniature satellite system. This study will explore whether this system can be used in the future to more accurately place the needle in or near the desired location or abnormality.\n\nPatients 18 years of age and older who have a lesion that needs to be biopsied or an ablation procedure that requires CT guidance may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and review of medical records, including imaging studies.\n\nParticipants undergo the biopsy or ablation procedure as they normally would, with the following exceptions: some stickers are placed on the skin before the procedure and a very weak magnet is placed nearby. The needles used are similar to the ones that would normally be used except that they contain a metal coil or spring buried deep within the needle metal. The procedure involves the following steps:\n\n1. Small 1-cm plastic donuts are place on the skin with tape.\n2. A planning CT scan is done.\n3. The CT scan is sent to the computer and matched to the patient's body location with the help of a very weak magnet.\n4. The needle used for the procedure is placed towards the target tissue or abnormality and the \"smart needle\" location lights up on the old CT scan.\n5. A repeat CT is done as it normally is to look for the location of the needle.\n6. After the procedure the CT scans are examined to determine how well the new tool located the needle in the old scan.",

      "summary": "This is a study to assess the ability of Indocyanine Green (ICG) to identify neoplastic disease. For many pediatric solid tumors, complete resection of the primary site and/or metastatic deposits is critical for achieving a cure. An optimal intra-operative tool to help visualize tumor and its margins would be of benefit. ICG real-time fluorescence imaging is a technique being used increasingly in adults for this purpose. We propose to use it during surgery for pediatric malignancies. All patients with tumors that require localization for resection or biopsy of the tumor and/or metastatic lesions will be eligible.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\nTo assess the feasibility of Indocyanine Green (ICG)-mediated near-infrared (NIR) imagery to identify neoplastic disease during the conduct of surgery to resect neoplastic lesions in children and adolescents. NIR imaging will be done at the start of surgery to assess NIR-positivity of the lesion(s) and at the end of surgery to assess completeness of resection. Separate assessments will be made for the following different histologic categories:\n\n1. Osteosarcoma\n2. Neuroblastoma\n3. Metastatic pulmonary deposits - closed to accrual\n\nExploratory Objectives\n\n1. To compare the ICG uptake by primary vs metastatic site and pre-treated (chemotherapy, radiation, or both) vs non-pre-treated.\n2. Assess the sensitivity and specificity of NIR imagery to find additional lesions not identified by standard of care intraoperative inspection and tactile feedback.\n3. Assess the sensitivity and specificity of NIR imagery to find additional lesions not identified on preoperative diagnostic imaging.\n4. Assess the sensitivity and specificity of NIR imagery for identifying residual disease at the conclusion of a tumor resection.\n\nSeparate assessments will be made for the following different histologic categories based on their actual enrollment; this includes but is not limited to analyzing multiple arms together:\n\n1. Ewing Sarcoma\n2. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)\n3. Non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcoma (NRSTS)\n4. Renal tumors\n5. Liver tumors, lymphoma, other rare tumors, and nodules of unknown etiology",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Axitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Surgery to remove the kidney, called a nephrectomy, is also considered standard of care; however, doctors who treat kidney cancer do not agree on its benefits. It is not yet known if the addition of surgery to an immunotherapy-based drug combination works better than an immunotherapy-based drug combination alone in treating patients with kidney cancer.",

      "summary": "Esophagectomy is the cornerstone of the curative treatment of esophageal carcinoma. Despite this treatment, patients can suffer from locoregional or distant metastatic disease and only a very selected group of patients can be cured: mostly those with recurrence in one single organ.\n\nBrain metastases are rare after esophagectomy for cancer, but they have a serious impact on survival. Agressive treatment is often moren difficult for brain metastases compared to other metastases and some risk factors have been identified earlier.\n\nThere is an impression that the incidence of brain metastases in esophageal cancer patients has increased since the introduction of neoadjuvant treatment schemes. However, this is not clear yet. A potential explanation could be that chemotherapy disturbs the blood-brain-barrier, hereby facilitating the migration of tumor cells to the brain.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze the incidence and potential risk factors of brain metastases in patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Patients treated between 2000 and 2019 will be included and outcome parameters are Odds Ratio for brain metastases (comparison between primary surgery and neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery), time to recurrence and risk factors, number and characteristics of the brain metastases.",

APL-2 may limit tumor progression, decrease malignant effusion production, and improve the immune system's response against cancer cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving APL-2 together with either pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab and bevacizumab may work better in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and malignant effusion compared to bevacizumab alone.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial studies the effects of combination therapy with bevacizumab, erlotinib, and atezolizumab in treating patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and kidney cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. They work by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumors. This may slow the growth and spread of tumors. Erlotinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of a protein called EGFR that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Combination therapy with bevacizumab, erlotinib, and atezolizumab may stabilize or shrink advanced hereditary leiomyomatosis and kidney cancer.",

      "summary": "Renal autotransplantation (RAT) is a method of removing a kidney from its place of origin in a patient, repairing it, and transplanting it in another location of the body, generally the iliac fossa of the same patient.RAT is a relatively new technique; the first ever RAT procedure in the US was performed in 1963. Advances in preservation and transplantation techniques have made RAT a modality that can be utilized in complex renal diseases. RAT is indicated for conditions such as renal vascular disease, nutcracker syndrome, pelvic venous congestion, pelvic trauma, refractory stone disease and, in some cases, loin pain hematuria syndrome and conventionally unresectable renal tumors.\n\nIrrespective of the excellent outcomes shown by RAT, the conventional open approach requires a large midline xiphoid-to-pubis or flank incision for donor nephrectomy with a second pelvic incision for renal transplantation into the iliac fossa.The current gold standard approach to RAT is a laparoscopic nephrectomy followed by open auto-transplantation. However, this approach still requires a large pelvic incision. Robotic technology enables us to perform more complex minimally invasive surgery. Gordon et al. performed and reported the first completely intracorporeal robotic RAT to repair a ureteral injury in 2014.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial tests whether adding trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk (Herceptin Hylecta \\[TM\\]) or pertuzumab, trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-zzxf (Phesgo \\[TM\\]) to the usual chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) works to shrink tumors in patients with HER2 positive endometrial cancer. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies and forms of targeted therapy that attach to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab or pertuzumab attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Hyaluronidase is an endoglycosidase. It helps to keep pertuzumab and trastuzumab in the body longer, so that these medications will have a greater effect. Hyaluronidase also allows trastuzumab and trastuzumab/pertuzumab to be given by injection under the skin and shortens their administration time compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab alone. Paclitaxel is a taxane and in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Giving Herceptin Hylecta or Phesgo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin may shrink the tumor and prevent the cancer from coming back in patients with HER2 positive endometrial cancer.",

This Phase III trial builds on the efficacy and safety data reported in the previous Phase II VIRO-15 trial with promising objective response rate and progression-free survival observed in heavily pre-treated patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. The phase II results also showed that the intra-peritoneal route of delivery was efficient in generating tumor cell killing and immune activation, and led to clinical reversal of platinum-resistance or refractoriness in this difficult-to-treat patient population.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests whether using genetic testing of tumor tissue to select the optimal treatment regimen works in treating patients with clear cell renal cell (kidney) cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic). The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved regimens for advanced kidney cancer fall into two categories. One treatment combination includes two immunotherapy drugs (nivolumab plus ipilimumab), which are delivered by separate intravenous infusions into a vein. The other combination is one immunotherapy drug (nivolumab infusion) plus an oral pill taken by mouth (cabozantinib). Nivolumab and ipilimumab are \"immunotherapies\" which release the brakes of the immune system, thus allowing the patient's own immune system to better kill cancer cells. Cabozantinib is a \"targeted therapy\" specifically designed to block certain biological mechanisms needed for growth of cancer cells. In kidney cancer, cabozantinib blocks a tumor's blood supply. The genetic (DNA) makeup of the tumor may affect how well it responds to therapy. Testing the makeup (genes) of the tumor, may help match a treatment (from one of the above two treatment options) to the specific cancer and increase the chance that the disease will respond to treatment. The purpose of this study is to learn if genetic testing of tumor tissue may help doctors select the optimal treatment regimen to which advanced kidney cancer is more likely to respond.",

Because no dosing or adverse event (AE) data are currently available on the use of nivolumab and ipilimumab in kidney transplant recipients \\<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future pediatric trials\n* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed non-uveal melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma for which standard non-immunological medical, surgical, or radiation therapy would be insufficient (i.e., patients who are not surgical candidates). Patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or Merkel cell carcinoma may enroll without prior medical therapy (e.g., cetuximab or chemotherapy respectively). Non-immunologic standard therapies that patients must have received, refused or for which patients were ineligible include:\n\n  * For patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, prior therapies include BRAF/MEK inhibitors\n  * For patients with Basal cell carcinoma, prior therapies include hedgehog pathway inhibitors\n* Patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, i.e., at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as \\>= 20 mm by chest x-ray or as \\>= 10 mm with CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam is preferred, but not required\n* Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =\\< 2 (Karnofsky \\>= 60%) performance status criteria\n* Leukocytes \\>= 2,000/mcL\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\>= 1,500/mcL\n* Platelets \\>= 50,000/mcL\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) =\\< 2.5 x institutional ULN\n* Serum creatinine =\\< 3 x ULN\n* dd-cfDNA =\\< 1.0% and =\\< 61% increase\n* The effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) receiving nivolumab must continue contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception.\n\nWOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin \\[B-HCG\\]) during the screening period. Follow-up evaluations will include interval sexual/menstrual histories as needed.\n\nShould a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) should inform the treating physician immediately.\n\nWOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. Women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL to be considered postmenopausal.\n\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients will be eligible for this trial if they are on effective antiretroviral regimens utilizing non-CYP-interactive agents and have an undetectable viral load. If there is evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated. If there is history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the patient must have been treated and have undetectable HCV viral load.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Legally authorized representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have received a liver, lung, heart, or pancreas transplant; or allogeneic stem cell transplant; or any kind of bone marrow transplant\n* Patients unwilling or unable to undergo dialysis in the event of allograft failure\n* Patients with prior evidence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or non-HLA donor-specific antibodies (DSA)\n* Patients with a history of antibody- or cell-mediated allograft rejection within 3 months of study entry\n* Potential trial participants should have recovered from clinically significant adverse events of their most recent therapy/intervention prior to enrollment\n* Patients may have received prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy; however, patients must not have any other checkpoint antibody targeting T-cell co-stimulation within 1 year of study enrollment. Prior history of adjuvant therapy is allowed if received over 1 year prior to enrollment. Prior receipt of oncolytic therapy (e.g., TVEC, RP1) is allowed\n* Patients must not be receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients with leptomeningeal metastases, more than 3 untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases, untreated brain metastases measuring \\>1cm, or requiring treatment-dose steroids (\\> 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for CNS-related symptoms. Exclusions are due to concerns regarding progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other AEs. Patients with brain metastases meeting the above requirements are permitted to enroll\n* Patients must not have a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody\n* Patients must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to other agents used in the study\n* Patients must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or any other significant condition(s) that would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab and ipilimumab have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab or ipilimumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Patients with autoimmune disease that is active or might recur and affect vital organ function will be eligible only after consultation with the study PI. Guillain-Barre (GB) syndrome, bullous skin disease, Stevens Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis will be excluded\n* Patients must not have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, GI obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need for additional treatment before coming on study. In addition, patients with a history of cardiac disease including coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, heart block, should have an evaluation by history pulmonary embolism (PE) and appropriate testing to allow evaluation of any events that may occur on study. These may include troponin, electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (ECHO) as clinically indicated and may include results already in the medical record if available",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the impact of subcutaneous (SC) nivolumab given in an in-home setting to an in-clinic setting on cancer care and quality of life. Currently, most drug-related cancer care is conducted in clinic type centers or hospitals which may isolate patients from family, friends and familiar surroundings for many hours per day. This separation adds to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families. Traveling to and from medical facilities costs time, money, and effort and can be a disadvantage to patients living in rural areas, those with low incomes or poor access to transport. Studies have shown that cancer patients often feel more comfortable and secure being cared for in their own home environments. SC nivolumab in-home treatment may be safe, tolerable and/or effective when compared to in-clinic treatment and may reduce the burden of cancer and improve the quality of life in cancer patients.",

      "summary": "Researchers are looking for new ways to treat people with high-risk muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (MIUC). Urothelial carcinoma is a type of bladder cancer that begins in cells that line the inside of the bladder and other parts of the urinary tract, such as part of the kidneys, ureters, and urethra. People with MIUC usually have chemotherapy before surgery, then surgery to remove the cancer. Chemotherapy is a type of medicine to destroy cancer cells or stop them from growing. After surgery, some people receive more treatment to prevent cancer from returning. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, which is a treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer. Enfortumab vedotin (EV) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). An ADC attaches to a protein on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells. Researchers want to learn if giving intismeran autogene (the study treatment) with pembrolizumab can prevent MIUC from returning after surgery. Intismeran autogene (also called mRNA-4157) is designed to treat each person's cancer by helping the person's immune system identify and kill cancer cells based on certain proteins found on those cancer cells.\n\nThe goals of this study are to learn if people who receive intismeran autogene and pembrolizumab are alive and cancer free longer than those who receive placebo and pembrolizumab, and to learn about the safety of intismeran autogene, pembrolizumab, and EV, and if people tolerate them.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the safety and effectiveness of 89Zr-DFO-GmAb positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) compared to contrast-enhanced CT after surgery in detecting clear cell renal cell cancer that has come back (recurrent). For some patients, the risk of recurrence after surgery remains high. Conventional CT methods, such as contrast-enhanced CT, may not detect small volume or micrometastatic disease. PET/CT with radiotracers, such as 89Zr-DFO-GmAb, may improve detection of tumor cells. Girentuximab (GmAb), a monoclonal antibody, is tagged with zirconium-89, a radioactive atom (which is also known as an isotope). The zirconium-89 (89Zr) isotope is attached to girentuximab with desferrioxamine (DFO) and this combined product is called 89Zr-DFO-girentuximab. 89Zr-DFO-girentuximab attaches itself to a protein on the surface of clear cell renal cell tumor cells called CAIX. PET is an established imaging technique that utilizes small amounts of radioactivity attached to very minimal amounts of tracer, in the case of this research, 89Zr-DFO-GmAb. Because some cancers, including clear cell renal cell cancer, take up 89Zr-DFO-GmAb it can be seen with PET. CT utilizes x-rays that traverse body from the outside. CT images provide an exact outline of organs and potential inflammatory tissue where it occurs in patient's body. Using contrast agents with CT scan to enhance the images (contrast-enhanced CT) is standard of care imaging. 89Zr-DFO-GmAb PET/CT may be safe and effective compared to contrast-enhanced CT in detecting recurrent clear cell renal cell cancer after surgery.",

      "summary": "This phase IV trial tests the impact of standard of care enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab followed by removal of all or part of the bladder (cytoreductive cystectomy) and/or removal of all or part of the tube that carriers urine from the kidneys to the bladder (ureterectomy) on outcomes in patients with bladder and upper urothelial tract that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Enfortumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, enfortumab, linked to an anticancer drug called vedotin. It works by helping the immune system to slow or stop the growth of tumor cells. Enfortumab attaches to a protein called nectin-4 on tumor cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. It is a type of antibody-drug conjugate. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving standard of care enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab followed by cytoreductive cystectomy and/or ureterectomy (CC/U) may improve outcomes in patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder or upper urothelial tract cancer.",

Inulin is a common food additive fermentable prebiotic fiber beneficial for a healthy gut microbiome. The microbiome is the collection of all microbes, such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and their genes, that naturally live on and inside the body. Inulin may also be used for cancer prevention and heart health, but there is less evidence to support those uses. The gut microbiome profile may improve the effectiveness of drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving inulin gel in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab may be safe and effective in treating in patients with metastatic or locally advanced RCC.",

Oncolytic viruses are designed to infect and destroy cancer cells and have the potential to stimulate the immune system to fight the tumor.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the safety of IDOV-Immune, how well it is tolerated, and to identify the highest dose that can be safely given. Researchers will also study how the drug behaves in the body, how the immune system responds to it, and whether it shows any signs of shrinking tumors.\n\nParticipants will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion of IDOV-Immune and will be closely monitored for side effects and any changes in their cancer.\n\nThis study is being conducted at multiple sites in the United States and Australia.",

The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Is it feasible to recruit and randomize people to both treatment groups?\n2. Does linking people to recovery community centers lead to better recovery outcomes?\n\nResearchers will compare linking people to recovery community centers (RCC) to enhanced treatment as usual to see if recovery outcomes are different.\n\nIn one group, participants will learn about their local RCC and will be asked to visit their local RCC on at least two days and write about their experiences. In the other group, participants will learn about different recovery activities, pick any two, and do the activities of their choice on at least two days. They will also be asked to write about their experiences.\n\nPeople in both groups will answer online survey questions about their recovery outcomes and well-being in five surveys over one year.",

Participants in arm 2 will receive the same, but will proceed with their standard of care cryoablation after the initial PET scan. Within 3 days of the cryoablation treatment, participants will receive a repeat PET scan.",
