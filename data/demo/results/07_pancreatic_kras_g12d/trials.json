Patients included in the registry may include those with: pancreatic cancer, precancerous lesions of the pancreas, inflammatory lesions of the pancreas, cystic lesions of the pancreas, and patients at high-risk of pancreatic cancer such as those with a family history of pancreatic cancer or with a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. However, little is known about the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases in individuals with the above conditions. Knowledge of how family history, environmental exposures, and inflammatory lesion of the pancreas contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases is essential.\n\nYou may qualify to take part in this research study because you have inflammation in the pancreas, a pancreatic cyst, pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas, pancreatic cancer, a family history of pancreatic cancer, or a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer.\n\nWe will also be collecting a blood sample from all participants for DNA isolation. Sometimes we are born with genes or DNA that give us an increased or decreased chance of developing an illness later in life. Genetic material will be isolated from your blood for further study. You may also choose to provide additional blood samples for serum and plasma extraction. Serum and plasma are components of the blood which can be used to measure indicators of disease in the blood, called biomarkers,for pancreatic diseases. Clinical data and biological specimens contained in this study may be used for a wide variety of future related studies to the cause, diagnosis, outcome and treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\nFunds for conducting this research are provided by Mount Sinai.",

      "summary": "This study is a first in human Phase 1 study that involves patients with a type of cancer called HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) positive cancer.\n\nThis study asks patients to volunteer to take part in a research study investigating the safety and efficacy of using special immune cells called HER2 chimeric antigen receptor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (HER2 specific CAR T cells), in combination with intra-tumor injection of CAdVEC, an oncolytic adenovirus that is designed to help the immune system including HER2 specific CAR T cell react to the tumor.\n\nThe study is looking at combining these two treatments together, because we think that the combination of treatments will work better than each treatment alone. We also hope to learn the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.\n\nIn this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor cells.\n\nInvestigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. Both CAdVEC and HER2-specific autologous CAR T are investigational products. They are not approved by the FDA.",

      "summary": "This is a research study to evaluate how the genetic makeup of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) can affect the response to FDA-approved chemotherapy treatment, FOLFIRINOX, given before surgery to remove the tumor. Certain types of PDAC tumors can be surgically resected (removed). However, not all types of PDACs are resectable, especially if they are close to important structures like blood vessels or intestines. These types of PDACs are treated with chemotherapy such as FOLFIRINOX. Research studies showed that chemotherapy after surgical resection of PDAC tumors reduced the risk of the cancer returning.\n\nChemotherapy is used to treat PDAC that has not spread outside of the pancreas and is not resectable. FOLFIRINOX is a chemotherapy treatment that combines multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan, and 5-FU. Patients receive these agents by intravenous infusion. Of these drugs, 5-FU requires you to return home with a chemotherapy pump that will deliver chemotherapy over 46 hours. This regimen has been studied in pancreatic cancer that has been removed with surgery as a method for preventing the cancer from returning. Studies showed FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy reduced the risk of cancer returning and increased patients survival. In this study, researchers want to know if FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy given before surgery will make the cancer easier to remove with surgery and increase the chances of the cancer staying away after surgery.\n\nResearchers have shown that pancreatic cancers are not all the same when you look at the DNA and RNA that is inside a pancreatic cancer cell.\n\nDepending on the expression of different genes in a cancer cell, some pancreatic cancers may respond differently to chemotherapy. In this study researchers want to know if FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy can change the genetic profile of the cancer. This will be studied by obtaining a biopsy of the cancer before the start of chemotherapy, and after 8 treatments of chemotherapy. They will also study cancer cells that will be collected from blood samples.",

Validation of cobimetinib, olaparib, onvansertib azenosertib, AZD5305 and tremelimumab molecular targets will be explored by comparing pre-treatment biopsies with post-treatment specimens. This knowledge will help design future biomarker driven trials to determine whether giving cobimetinib, or olaparib, or onvansertib or azenosertib, or AZD5305, or tremelimumab will work better than standard treatments in patients with pancreatic cancer.",

      "summary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of modified immune cells (IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells) after a chemotherapy conditioning regimen for the treatment of patients with stage IIIC or IV melanoma or solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic). The study agent is called IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells. T cells are a special type of white blood cell (immune cells) that have the ability to kill tumor cells. The T cells are obtained from the patient's own blood, grown in a laboratory, and modified by adding the IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene. The IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene is inserted into T cells with a virus called a lentivirus. The lentivirus allows cells to make the IL13Ralpha2 CAR protein. This CAR has been designed to bind to a protein on the surface of tumor cells called IL13Ralpha2. This study is being done to determine the dose at which the gene-modified immune cells are safe, how long the cells stay in the body, and if the cells are able to attack the cancer.",

Many of these cysts may be precursors to pancreatic cancer, and thus pose a substantial risk, however, the vast majority are benign. Increased detection of pancreatic cysts provides an opportunity to diagnose pancreatic malignancy at an early, curable stage yet also increases the potential to over-treat clinically insignificant lesions. This presents a clinical challenge to prevent unnecessary resection of indolent disease, with associated risks of infections, bleeding, diabetes, and costly disability. Unfortunately, there is little information on the epidemiology and natural history of pancreatic cysts to help guide management.",

      "summary": "Over the past three decades, the treatment of both primary and secondary liver malignancies has been improved by the development and optimization of multiple minimally invasive thermal ablative therapies. These advances have resulted in a myriad of benefits for patients including decreased morbidity, mortality, as well as increased longevity and quality of life. However, these therapies can only be performed within certain parameters. Thermal ablative techniques such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MVA) are recommended for small lesions under 3 cm due to decreased efficacy when attempting to treat larger lesions. Additionally, large vessels in close proximity to a target lesion may result in heat dissipation, termed the \"heat sink\" effect, and result in incomplete ablation of the lesion. Furthermore, thermal ablative techniques cause off-target damage when utilized near sensitive structures such as the diaphragm, stomach, or bowel, and if performed near thermosensitive bile ducts, can result in cholestasis . Noting these limitations, percutaneous high-dose-rate brachytherapy was brought into clinical practice by Ricke et al. in Europe in 2002 . This therapy utilizes an iridium-192 (192Ir) isotope to administer a cytotoxic dose of radiation to a target lesion. It is not susceptible to heat sink effects and can also deliver radiation with the precision necessary to cause tumor death without destroying the integrity of neighboring structures. Additionally, it can be used to treat larger tumors (\\>3cm) as it is not associated the same size limitations as ablative techniques and can also be utilized to treat lesions that are not amenable to intra-arterial therapies (such as trans-arterial chemoembolization and yttrium-90 radioembolization).\n\nSince its inception, HDRBT has been evaluated through multiple studies investigating its use to treat lesions throughout the body including both primary and secondary liver malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma, metastasis to the liver from colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer , melanoma , and breast cancer . Its use in treating lymph node metastases has also been investigated . These studies have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and clinical effectiveness of this method, establishing it as a therapeutic option when use of thermal ablation therapies is restricted. Most studies however, have been retrospective and have been performed outside the United States.\n\nStudying this therapy will add a crucial treatment option to our current armamentarium, filling a gap in currently available therapies and additionally allowing for further investigation of the use of HDRBT in a larger and more diverse population.",

CA-4948 is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of abnormal proteins called interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) that signal cells to multiply. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. The usual approach for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is treatment with chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making DNA and may kill cancer cells. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Nab-paclitaxel is an albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of paclitaxel. Giving CA-4948 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel may shrink or stabilize metastatic or unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.",

      "summary": "Genes contain genetic code which tell the body which proteins to make. Some types of cancer are caused by changes, or mutations, in a gene called KRAS. Researchers are looking for ways to stop the actions of abnormal proteins made from the mutated KRAS gene. The so-called G12D mutation in the KRAS gene is common in people with some solid tumors.\n\nASP4396 is being developed as a potential new treatment for solid tumors in people who have the G12D mutation in their KRAS gene. ASP4396 is not currently available as a treatment for the public. In this study, researchers will learn how ASP4396 is processed by and acts upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose and to check for potential medical problems from ASP4396.\n\nIn this study, ASP4396 is being given to humans for the first time.\n\nPeople in this study will be adults with locally advanced (unresectable), or metastatic solid tumors with the G12D mutation in their KRAS gene. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. They may have been previously treated with standard therapies or refused to receive those treatments.\n\nThe main aims of the study are to check the safety of ASP4396, how well people cope with medical problems during the study (how well it is tolerated), and to find a suitable dose of ASP4396.\n\nThis is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that they will receive ASP4396.\n\nThis study will be in 2 parts.\n\nPart 1 is called Dose Escalation. Different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of ASP4396. For each dose, all medical problems will be recorded. The first group will receive the lowest dose of ASP4396. A medical expert panel will check the results and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP4396. The panel will do this until all groups have taken ASP4396 or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.\n\nPart 2 is called Dose Expansion. Other different small groups of people will receive ASP4396 with the most suitable doses worked out from Part 1. This will help find a more accurate dose of ASP4396 to use in future studies.\n\nIn both parts of the study, ASP4396 will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each treatment cycle is 21 days long. People will continue treatment until: they have medical problems from the treatment they can't cope with (can't tolerate); their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; or they ask to stop treatment.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic on certain days during their treatment, with extra visits during the first 2 cycles of treatment. The study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP4396. Also, people in the study will have a health check including blood tests. On some visits they will also have scans to check for any changes in their cancer. Tumor samples will be taken at certain visits during treatment with the option of a tumor sample being taken after treatment has finished.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic about 7 days after they stop treatment. They will be asked about any medical problems and will have a health check including blood tests.\n\nAfter this, people will visit the clinic for a health check several times. The number of visits and checks done at each visit will depend on the health of each person and whether they completed their treatment or not.\n\nAfter treatment has finished, people in the study will be followed up for up to 45 weeks.",

        "raw_text": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAge 18\n\nHistologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\nHistologic / cytologic confirmation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma may come from the primary tumor (i.e., via FNA at initial diagnosis). Histological/pathologic confirmation of distant metastatic disease is not required if clinical and radiographic consensus is that the patient has distant metastatic disease.\n\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \u22642\n\nCandidate for MDT (including radiation therapy, surgical resection, ablation, and embolization) to all sites of disease including oligometastatic sites and if present intact primary / regional nodal disease.\n\nBetween one and five distant metastatic lesions, counted as follows: each lesion (not site) will be counted as one, with the exception of metastatic lymph node stations, which will collectively count as one lesion. Regional nodal stations will be counted as a collective single lesion if present. All progressive lesions must be amenable to local therapy as noted in criterion 4.2.1.4 above.\n\nCounting of oligometastatic nodal disease will be based on nodal chains. A nodal chain will be considered a single metastatic lesion if the presence of that node results in the patient as having M1 disease per the TNM staging system, AJCC version 8.0. In addition, one of the following criteria must be met: a) \u22651 LN meets radiologic criteria for metastatic disease via RECIST 1.1 (short axis \u226515mm), b) pathologic assessment has confirmed the presence of metastatic cancer cells, and/or c) the LN exhibits imaging signal characteristic of a metastatic lesion (e.g. FDG avidity, contrast enhancement, etc.). In the event of ambiguity or equivocal findings, the principal investigator or co-principal investigator will make a final determination of whether criteria are met. The following caveats apply:\n\nIn patients with a LN exhibiting a short axis \u226515mm and who have other diagnoses that can produce enlarged LNs (e.g. indolent CLL, sarcoidosis, etc\u2026) or a prior history of benign enlarged LNs will not be considered to have metastatic disease per the discretion of the treating physician.\n\nLN chains that occur bilaterally will be considered separate metastatic sites. For example, left axilla LNs will counted separately from right axilla LNs.\n\nThe following midline LN chains will be counted as 1 metastatic site: mediastinal, para-aortic, mesenteric.\n\nThe following bilateral LN chains will be counted as 1 metastatic site for unilateral involvement, and 2 for bilateral for involvement: preauricular, cervical and occipital, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, pectoral, axillary, hilar, epitrochlear and brachial, iliac, inguinal and femoral, popliteal.\n\nBaseline imaging must include a scan done within 4 weeks prior to randomization, demonstrating oligometastatic disease by RECIST (v1.1) criteria compared to pre-baseline imaging.\n\nBaseline imaging must be done within 4 weeks prior to randomization, and the following imaging is required: PET/CT scan or CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis. MRI may be substituted as indicated (i.e., CT scan of chest plus MRI abdomen/pelvis).\n\nDiagnostic laparoscopy may be indicated prior to enrollment if any concern for peritoneal disease / carcinomatosis is present, at the investigator's discretion. Presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis will exclude the patient from this trial as below. Indications for peritoneal carcinomatosis may include findings concerning for but not definitive for peritoneal disease on diagnostic imaging, elevated CA-19-9, and clinical symptoms concerning for peritoneal disease.\n\nPatients referred for the study that require immediate MDT can receive treatment to CNS lesions or other symptomatic lesions prior to randomization, but these lesions will be counted towards the total number of oligometastatic lesions.\n\nPatients with \\&gt;5 discrete metastatic sites previously with subsequent 'induction' of oligometastatic disease (\\&lt;=5 discrete sites; induction via response to systemic therapy) may be eligible if 5 or fewer metastatic disease sites have been present / noted radiographically for a minimum of 6 months, and pending principal investigator review/discretion.\n\nFemales of childbearing potential must not be breast feeding and must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test and must agree to use adequate contraception from the time of screening until 3 months after discontinuation of the study medication. Acceptable methods of contraception include total and true sexual abstinence, tubal ligation, hormonal contraceptives that are not prone to drug-drug interactions (IUS Levonorgestrel Intra Uterine System (Mirena), Medroxyprogesterone injections (Depo-Provera), copper-banded intra-uterine devices, and vasectomized partner. All hormonal methods of contraception should be used in combination with the use of a condom by their sexual male partner. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause). Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements must also apply: Women \\&lt; 50 years old: they would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments. The levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) must also be in the post-menopausal range (as per the institution). Women \u2265 50 years old: they would be consider post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, or have had radiation-induced oophorectomy with the last menses \\&gt; 1 year ago, or have had chemotherapy-induced menopause with \\&gt;1 year interval since last menses, or have had surgical sterilization by either bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy.\n\nNon-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and 6 months after the last dose of study medication. Adequate contraception methods include: birth control pills (e.g. combined oral contraceptive pill), barrier protection (e.g. condom plus spermicide, cervical/vault cap or intrauterine device), and abstinence. Patients should not father a child for 6 months after completion of the study medication. Patients should refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months after discontinuing the study medication. If male patients wish to father children they should be advised to arrange for freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of the study medication.\n\nDemonstration of adequate organ function as defined in the table below, all screening labs to be performed within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment:\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nMetastatic effusion (e.g. pleural effusion or ascites). Note that patients with an effusion that is too small to sample will be eligible for the trial.\n\nLeptomeningeal disease.\n\nPeritoneal carcinomatosis.\n\nCognitively impaired subjects (e.g. inability to sign informed consent.)\n\nAny condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the study treatment or interpretation of the study results.\n\nDiffuse bone marrow involvement as defined by disease involvement of a BM biopsy from a site that does not have radiologic evidence of a bone metastasis.\n\nMore than 4 prior lines of systemic therapy to treat metastatic disease.\n\nDiagnosis of active scleroderma, lupus, or other rheumatologic disease which in the opinion of the treating radiation oncologist precludes safe delivery of radiotherapy. Such patients may be eligible if dispositioned to non-radiotherapy MDT.\n\nKnown psychiatric or substance abuse disorder/s that would interfere with trial participation.\n\nConcurrent (synchronous or metachronous) other primary malignancy that in the opinion of the treating physician team presents a substantial risk to the patient's life as a competing risk of death (against the primary oligometastatic pancreatic cancer being considered for MDT as part of this trial).",

      "summary": "This study evaluates an investigational scan called hyperpolarized carbon-13 pyruvate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in assessing treatment response in patients with pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDA) that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). MRI is a standard scan that helps doctors see tumors, organs, tissue, and bone. Standard contrast agents (e.g., gadolinium) are sometimes used to help make the scan images brighter, or easier to see. Hyperpolarized carbon-13 pyruvate is an experimental contrast agent that is different from standard MRI contrast in that it provides information on how a tumor processes nutrients. Hyperpolarized carbon-13 pyruvate MRI scans may work better than MRI with standard contrast agents in predicting how PDA tumors respond to treatment.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of using lanreotide before surgery to surgery alone in preventing pancreatic fistulas in patients with pancreatic cancer or a pancreatic lesion that could become cancerous. Lanreotide, a type of somatostatin analog similar to somatostatin (a hormone made by the body), and is used to treat certain types of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and carcinoid syndrome. It may help stop the body from making extra amounts of certain hormones, including growth hormone, insulin, glucagon, and hormones that affect digestion. It may also help keep certain types of tumor cells from growing. Patients with pancreatic cancer or pancreatic lesions may undergo surgery to remove parts of the pancreas, also called a distal pancreatectomy. Patients may experience complications after surgery, including pancreatic fistulas. A pancreatic fistula occurs when there is a small leak from the pancreas, causing fluids to collect. This can often lead to infection and other problems. Giving lanreotide before undergoing distal pancreatectomy may be more effective than surgery alone in preventing the development of a pancreatic fistula in patients with pancreatic cancer or a pancreatic lesion that could become cancerous.",

Irinotecan is in a class of antineoplastic medications called topoisomerase I inhibitors. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair and may kill tumor cells. Liposomal irinotecan is a form of the anticancer drug irinotecan that is contained inside very tiny, fat-like particles. Liposomal irinotecan may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of the drug. Oxaliplatin is in a class of medications called platinum-containing antineoplastic agents. It damages the cell's DNA and may kill tumor cells. 5-fluorouracil, a type of antimetabolite, stops cells from making DNA and it may kill tumor cells. Leucovorin, a form of folic acid, is used to lessen the toxic effects of substances that block the action of folic acid. It is a type of chemoprotective agent and a type of chemosensitizing agent. Giving NALIRIFOX before surgery may improve the chance of successful surgery and decrease the chance of the cancer returning after surgery in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.",

The targeted area is then heated, which kills the pancreatic cancer cells, and as a result, the patient's life may be prolonged. Experience with Suizenji for pancreatic cancer patients has shown that the \"heating\" is only a warm feeling in the abdomen during the treatment.",

      "summary": "Genes contain genetic code which tell the body which proteins to make. Many types of cancer are caused by changes, or mutations, in a gene called KRAS. Researchers are looking for ways to stop the actions of abnormal proteins made from the mutated KRAS gene.\n\nASP5834 is being studied in people with solid tumors who have certain KRAS gene mutations. Some people with solid tumors of the colon or rectum (colorectal cancer), will be given ASP5834 with panitumumab. Panitumumab is a treatment for colorectal cancer. In this study, the researchers will learn how ASP5834 is processed by and acts upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose of ASP5834 and check for any potential medical problems from the treatment.\n\nThe main aims of this study are to check the safety of ASP5834 given by itself or given with panitumumab, and how well it is tolerated; and to find a suitable dose of ASP5834 given by itself or given with panitumumab.\n\nPeople in this study will be adults with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumors with certain KRAS gene mutations. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The key reasons people cannot take part are if they have specific uncontrollable cancers such as symptomatic or untreated cancers in nervous system, or have a specific heart condition, or infections.\n\nIn this study, ASP5834 is being given to humans for the first time. This is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that they will receive ASP5834 by itself or ASP5834 with panitumumab.\n\nThis study will be in 2 parts:\n\nPart 1 is called Dose Escalation. Different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of either: ASP5834 by itself or ASP5834 with panitumumab. Only people who have colorectal cancer will receive ASP5834 with panitumumab. People with any type of solid tumor will receive ASP5834 by itself. For each dose, all medical problems will be recorded. A medical expert panel will check the results and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP5834. The panel will do this until the planned maximum number of people are treated or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.\n\nPart 2 is called Dose Expansion. Other different small groups of people will receive ASP5834 or ASP5834 with panitumumab. They will receive the most suitable doses worked out from Part 1.\n\nIn both parts of the study, the study treatments ASP5834 and panitumumab will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each study treatment cycle is either 21 days or 28 days long. People will continue study treatment until: they have medical problems from the study treatment they can't tolerate; their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; or they ask to stop study treatment.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic on certain days during their study treatment, with extra visits during the first 2 cycles of study treatment. The study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP5834. Also, people in the study will have a health check. On some visits they will also have scans to check for any changes in their cancer. Tumor samples will be taken at certain visits during study treatment with the option of a tumor sample being taken if people's cancer gets worse or the cancer comes back.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic shortly after stopping treatment for a health check. After this, people will have health checks every couple of months to check the condition of their cancer. The number of visits and checks done will depend on the health of each person and whether they completed their study treatment or not. It is expected that people will be in this study for about 1 year.",

PET is an established imaging technique that utilizes small amounts of radioactivity attached to very minimal amounts of tracer, in the case of this research, 68Ga-FAPi-46. Because some cancers take up 68Ga-FAPi-46, it can be seen with PET. CT utilizes x-rays that traverse the body from the outside. CT images provide an exact outline of organs and potential inflammatory tissue where it occurs in a patient's body. Combining a PET scan with a CT scan can help make the image easier to interpret. PET/CT scans are hybrid scanners that combine both modalities into a single scan during the same examination.",

      "summary": "This phase I/II trial tests the effect of pegcetacoplan in combination with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil (mFOLFIRINOX) in treating patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Pegcetacoplan works by targeting the immune complement process, a part of the immune system that defends against bacteria and may limit tumor progression and improve the immune system's response against tumor cells. Oxaliplatin is in a class of medications called platinum-containing antineoplastic agents. It damages the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill tumor cells. Irinotecan is in a class of antineoplastic medications called topoisomerase I inhibitors. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill tumor cells. Leucovorin is a drug used to lessen the toxic effects of substances that block the action of folic acid. Leucovorin is a form of folic acid. It is a type of chemoprotective agent and a type of chemosensitizing agent. Fluorouracil stops cells from making DNA and it may kill tumor cells. It is a type of antimetabolite. Giving pegcetacoplan in combination with mFOLFIRINOX may be safe, tolerable, and/or effecting in treating patients with metastatic PDAC. This trial also evaluates the effect of pegcetacoplan on the incidence of major thrombotic events and the resulting complications. Thrombosis is a common complication in patients with PDAC. Thrombosis occurs when blood clots block veins or arteries. Complications of thrombosis, such as stroke or heart attack, can be life-threatening. Giving pegcetacoplan may help prevent blood clots from forming and decrease the risk of major thrombotic events.",

      "summary": "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers remain a major global health burden, largely due to the lack of effective and accessible early screening strategies. Current diagnostic approaches-including endoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-are either invasive, resource-intensive, or insufficiently sensitive for detecting early-stage disease, and are therefore not suitable for population-wide screening or for simultaneously identifying multiple GI tumor types. As a result, many patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, when therapeutic options are limited and prognosis is poor.\n\nCirculating microRNAs (miRNAs) offer a promising alternative, as they are stable in peripheral blood and reflect tumor-related molecular alterations. In this study, the investigators aim to develop and validate a robust, noninvasive miRNA-based signature capable of distinguishing GI cancers from non-malignant controls. By integrating multi-cohort datasets and applying machine learning-based feature selection and predictive modeling, the investigators will construct a screening panel optimized for reproducibility, scalability, and early-stage detection. This noninvasive miRNA signature has the potential to support accessible, cost-effective, and clinically practical population-level screening for GI cancers, ultimately facilitating earlier diagnosis and improving outcomes for participants.",
