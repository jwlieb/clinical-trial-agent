- **Confidence**: 80%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which is included in the conditions studied
- Patient has a KRAS G12D mutation, which is required
- Patient has ECOG status of 1, which meets the requirement
- Patient's disease is advanced and unresectable, meeting the trial's definition

- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 75%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age: 67
- Sex: male
- Cancer type: pancreatic cancer
- ECOG status: 1
- Brain metastases: none
- Prior therapies: completed FOLFIRINOX x8 cycles and switched to gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel due to neuropathy, currently with radiographic progression

### [NCT06411691](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06411691)

**Pooled Mutant KRAS-Targeted Long Peptide Vaccine Combined With Balstilimab and Botensilimab for Patients With Stage IV MMR-p Colorectal Cancer and Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma**

- **Sponsor**: Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 70%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has pancreatic cancer, which is a condition studied in the trial.
- Patient has received prior therapies which are in line with the trial criteria for prior treatment.
- Patient has a KRAS mutation (G12D), which is part of the eligibility criteria.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**

**? Uncertainties:**
- Adequate organ and marrow function is not explicitly confirmed in the patient profile.

**Assessment:**
> The patient has a suitable cancer type and the required KRAS mutation. They meet the treatment line criteria, but their ECOG status conflicts with the trial's requirement, leading to a medium likelihood of eligibility. Verification of organ function is uncertain.

### [NCT06015659](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06015659)

**Phase 2 Single Arm Trial Testing the ZN-c3 WEE1 Inhibitor in Combination with Gemcitabine in Second-Line Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma**

- **Sponsor**: Brandon Huffman, MD
- **Phase**: Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 30%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, matching the trial condition.
- Patient is ECOG 1, which meets the trial criteria.
- Patient is 67 years old, meeting the age requirement (≥ 18 years).
- Patient has no brain metastases, which meets the criteria.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has previously received gemcitabine, which is excluded for progressing within 6 months of treatment.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Laboratory values for organ function (e.g., ANC, platelets, hemoglobin, bilirubin, ALT, and creatinine clearance) are not provided.

**Assessment:**
> The patient has advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma that matches the trial's focus. While the ECOG status and age are acceptable, the patient's history of receiving gemcitabine prior to progression creates a conflict with the trial's exclusion criteria. This leads to significant doubts about eligibility.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Measurable disease status** (per RECIST 1.1) - required for most therapeutic trials
- **Life expectancy estimate** - many trials require ≥3 months
- **Cardiac status/QTc interval** - relevant for trials with cardiotoxicity risk
