## Patient Profile

- **Age**: 71
- **Sex**: Male
- **Cancer Type**: squamous cell lung cancer

**Clinical Description**:
> 71-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell lung cancer, no actionable driver mutations identified (EGFR/ALK/ROS1/BRAF wild-type, KRAS wild-type). PD-L1 TPS ≥90%. First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy achieved durable response for 22 months, now progressed with new contralateral lung nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Seeking second-line immunotherapy combinations or novel checkpoint approaches. Former heavy smoker (50 pack-years). COPD on inhalers, no supplemental O2. Mild CKD (eGFR 52). Motivated patient willing to travel for trials.

- **Location Preference**: United States

## Search Summary

- **Search terms used**: 7
- **Total trials evaluated**: 100
- **Excluded by fast filter**: 98
- **LLM scored**: 2

## 🟡 MEDIUM Likelihood (1 trials)

### [NCT06403436](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06403436)

**A Phase 1, First-in-Human, Open-label Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of TT125-802 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors**

- **Sponsor**: TOLREMO therapeutics AG
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient is male and ≥ 18 years old
- Patient has a squamous cell lung cancer
- ECOG status of 1
- Patient has advanced solid tumors that have progressed after prior treatment

**? Uncertainties:**
- Laboratory values for adequate hematological, hepatic, and renal function are not provided
- Patient's life expectancy not explicitly stated

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial conditions as he has squamous cell lung cancer. He is a previously treated patient, which is acceptable according to trial criteria. However, there are uncertainties regarding organ function labs and life expectancy that need verification for a conclusive eligibility assessment.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Life expectancy estimate** - many trials require ≥3 months
