      "summary": "This study is a first in human Phase 1 study that involves patients with a type of cancer called HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) positive cancer.\n\nThis study asks patients to volunteer to take part in a research study investigating the safety and efficacy of using special immune cells called HER2 chimeric antigen receptor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (HER2 specific CAR T cells), in combination with intra-tumor injection of CAdVEC, an oncolytic adenovirus that is designed to help the immune system including HER2 specific CAR T cell react to the tumor.\n\nThe study is looking at combining these two treatments together, because we think that the combination of treatments will work better than each treatment alone. We also hope to learn the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.\n\nIn this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor cells.\n\nInvestigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. Both CAdVEC and HER2-specific autologous CAR T are investigational products. They are not approved by the FDA.",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Nerve damage is one of the most common and severe side effects of paclitaxel. The ability to consistently measure paclitaxel in the blood may allow doctors to control the dose of paclitaxel, so that enough chemotherapy is given to kill the cancer, but the side effect of nerve damage is reduced.",

The study agent is called IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells. T cells are a special type of white blood cell (immune cells) that have the ability to kill tumor cells. The T cells are obtained from the patient's own blood, grown in a laboratory, and modified by adding the IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene. The IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene is inserted into T cells with a virus called a lentivirus. The lentivirus allows cells to make the IL13Ralpha2 CAR protein. This CAR has been designed to bind to a protein on the surface of tumor cells called IL13Ralpha2. This study is being done to determine the dose at which the gene-modified immune cells are safe, how long the cells stay in the body, and if the cells are able to attack the cancer.",

      "summary": "This is a multipart, open-label, multi-center dose escalation, dose expansion phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and preliminary efficacy of MEM-288 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Eligible subjects must have a tumor lesion(s) which is accessible for injection.\n\nThe dose escalation phase (Part 1A - advanced solid tumors) has completed and is closed to enrollment. This phase evaluated multiple doses of MEM-288 dosed via intratumoral injection once every 3 weeks to assess safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and to determine the MTD.\n\nThe dose expansion phase has multiple parts for advanced NSCLC. Part 1B has completed after evaluation of MEM-288 dosed via intratumoral injection in combination with standard of care nivolumab dosed via intravenous injection.\n\nIn a separate dose expansion arm (Part 1C) that is open for enrollment, patients with advanced NSCLC will be randomized to receive either an initial priming dose of MEM-288 injected into an accessible lesion (s) alone (Day 1) followed by MEM-288 in combination with standard of care docetaxel every 3 weeks up to 6 doses or MEM-288 injected into an accessible lesion(s) in combination with standard of care docetaxel therapy Day 1 and every 3 weeks up to 6 doses.\n\nThe study rationale is that the oncolytic effect of MEM-288 combined with the presence of CD40L and type 1 IFN in injected tumors will provide a strong signal for DC-mediated T cell activation leading to generation of systemic anti-tumor T cell responses with broad specificity akin to what is observed in the abscopal effect.",

Capmatinib and osimertinib are in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. They work by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells and may help shrink tumors. Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody that may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Giving capmatinib, osimertinib, and/or ramucirumab and targeting abnormal gene changes in tumor cells may be effective in shrinking or stabilizing advanced non-small cell lung cancer.",

      "summary": "Although non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), c-ros oncogene 1(ROS1), and ret proto-oncogene (RET) gene fusions initially respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies, acquired resistance is inevitable. In many of these cases, increased activation of the erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homologue (ERBB) or cMet pathways appears to be a bypass signaling mechanism that allows these cancer cells to circumvent the selective pressure from TKIs. Recent data have suggested that these pathways compensate for each other in situations where one pathway is inhibited, leading to \"kinase switch\" drug resistance. Thus, the expected inhibition of both pathways via treatment with the amivantamab and combination TKI combination may improve overall efficacy by limiting the compensatory pathway activation.",

      "summary": "This study is open to adults 18 years and older with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. People can join the study if they have tumours with HER2 mutations and have not yet received any systemic therapy including chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called zongertinib (BI 1810631) can slow down the worsening of advanced non-small cell lung cancer better than the standard treatment available. Zongertinib may slow cancer cell growth by inhibiting HER2. This would prolong cancer re-occurrence and increase survival. Current standard treatment is pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy.\n\nParticipants are put into 2 groups by chance. One group receives zongertinib at regular times throughout the study and the other group receives infusions of pembrolizumab, pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin (pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy) into a vein.\n\nParticipants may be in the study up to a maximum of 70 months. During this time, they visit the study site about every 3 weeks for study procedures. The doctors regularly check the size of the tumour with a CT or MRI scan, at the beginning of the study and every 6 weeks. After 18 months they check the tumour size every 12 weeks. Doctors regularly check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects. The time it takes for the cancer to worsen is compared between the 2 groups to see whether the treatment works. The participants also fill in questionnaires about their symptoms and quality of life.",

Participants will either receive livmoniplimab (at different doses) in combination with budigalimab (another investigational drug) + chemotherapy, budigalimab +chemotherapy, or pembrolizumab +chemotherapy. In Stage 2, there are 2 treatments arms. Participants will either receive livmoniplimab (optimized dose) in combination with budigalimab +chemotherapy or placebo in combination with pembrolizumab +chemotherapy. Chemotherapy consists of IV Infused pemetrexed + IV infused cisplatin or IV infused or injected carboplatin. Approximately 840 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across 200 sites worldwide.\n\nStage 1: In cohort 1, participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused livmoniplimab (dose A)+ IV infused budigalimab, + chemotherapy for 4 cycles followed by livmoniplimab + budigalimab + IV Infused pemetrexed. In cohort 2, participants will receive livmoniplimab (dose B) + budigalimab + chemotherapy for 4 cycles followed by livmoniplimab + budigalimab + pemetrexed. In cohort 3, participants will receive budigalimab + chemotherapy for 4 cycles followed by budigalimab + pemetrexed . In cohort 4, participants will receive IV Infused pembrolizumab + chemotherapy for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab + pemetrexed. Stage 2: In arm 1, participants will receive livmoniplimab (dose optimized) + budigalimab + chemotherapy for 4 cycles followed by livmoniplimab + budigalimab + pemetrexed. In arm 2, participants will receive IV Infused placebo + pembrolizumab + chemotherapy for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab + pemetrexed. The estimated study duration is 55 months.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires, and scans.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the impact of subcutaneous (SC) nivolumab given in an in-home setting to an in-clinic setting on cancer care and quality of life. Currently, most drug-related cancer care is conducted in clinic type centers or hospitals which may isolate patients from family, friends and familiar surroundings for many hours per day. This separation adds to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families. Traveling to and from medical facilities costs time, money, and effort and can be a disadvantage to patients living in rural areas, those with low incomes or poor access to transport. Studies have shown that cancer patients often feel more comfortable and secure being cared for in their own home environments. SC nivolumab in-home treatment may be safe, tolerable and/or effective when compared to in-clinic treatment and may reduce the burden of cancer and improve the quality of life in cancer patients.",

      "summary": "Researchers are looking for new ways to treat metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has been treated before. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Nonsquamous means the cancer did not start in squamous cells, which are flat cells that line the inside of the lungs.\n\nStandard treatment (usual treatment) for NSCLC is surgery, then immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy after surgery. Immunotherapy is a treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer. Chemotherapy is a medicine that works to destroy cancer cells or stop them from growing.\n\nHowever, standard treatment may not work or may stop working for some people. Researchers want to know if 2 antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) can help treat metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC that did not respond (get smaller or go away) to treatment. An ADC attaches to specific targets on cancers cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells.\n\nResearchers will compare 2 different ADCs (the study treatments) to chemotherapy in this study. The goals of this study are to learn:\n\n* About the safety of the study treatments and if people tolerate them\n* How many people have the cancer respond to the study treatments",

Osi is a drug approved for the treatment of NSCLC. This study will be divided into two stages, in the first stage participants will receive increasing doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan with Osi. Participants will then be randomized into 4 groups called treatment arms where 3 groups will receive 1 of 3 optimized doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan from the dose escalation phase with Osi, or Osi alone. In the second stage participants will receive the optimal dose of telisotuzumab adizutecan, from the previous stage, with Osi, or SOC. Approximately 694 adult participants with mCRC will be enrolled in the study in 200 sites worldwide.\n\nIn Stage 1, during dose escalation participants will receive increasing intravenous (IV) doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan with oral Osi tablets. During dose optimization participants will receive OSi alone or with 1 of 3 optimized doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan. In stage 2 participnats will recieve the optimal dose of IV telisotuzumab adizutecanin with oral Osi tablet, or SOC. The study will run for a duration of approximately 76 months.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side effects.",
