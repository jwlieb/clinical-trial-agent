## 🟠 LOW Likelihood (5 trials)

### [NCT05853575](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05853575)

**A Randomized Study of Two Dosing Regimens of Adagrasib in Patients With Previously Treated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With KRAS G12C Mutation**

- **Sponsor**: Mirati Therapeutics Inc.
- **Phase**: Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 25%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age: 58
- Sex: female
- Cancer type: NSCLC
- Biomarkers: KRAS G12C
- ECOG status: 1
- Brain metastases: stable

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Failed first-line treatment with docetaxel and ramucirumab; trial requires previous treatment with cisplatin or carboplatin and an immune checkpoint inhibitor.
- Patient has stable brain metastases but recent treatment does not meet criteria due to inclusion criteria limitations on untreated brain lesions.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Labs: need more information on organ function besides mild anemia.

**Assessment:**
> While the patient's cancer type and biomarker are aligned with the trial's focus on NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutation, the patient's prior therapies do not meet the trial's treatment requirements. Furthermore, although the brain metastases are stable, the exclusion criteria may still be applicable based on the patient's treatment history and current condition. Therefore, the patient is likely excluded.

### [NCT06890598](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06890598)

**A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Olomorasib in Combination With Standard of Care Immunotherapy in Participants With Resected or Unresectable KRAS G12C-Mutant, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer - SUNRAY-02**

- **Sponsor**: Eli Lilly and Company
- **Phase**: Phase 3
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 25%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has histological confirmation of NSCLC.
- Patient has KRAS G12C mutation.
- Patient has ECOG performance status of 1.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient is classified as metastatic NSCLC with progressive disease, whereas trial eligibility specifically requires clinical Stage II-IIIB treated with presurgical chemoimmunotherapy or clinical Stage III unresectable NSCLC without progression on concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy.
- Patient's PD-L1 expression is <1%, which may not meet the threshold for trial inclusion depending on specific treatment arms.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Adequacy of laboratory parameters is not explicitly stated in the profile.

**Assessment:**
> The cancer type matches, but the patient's disease status with progressive NSCLC does not align with the trial's eligibility criteria for treatment stages. Additionally, the low PD-L1 TPS may be a restricting factor. Therefore, the patient is likely excluded.

### [NCT04852588](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04852588)

**Endoscopic Nodal Staging in Oligometastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Being Treated With Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (ENDO-SABR)**

- **Sponsor**: London Health Sciences Centre Research Institute OR Lawson Research Institute of St. Joseph's
- **Phase**: Not Applicable
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 25%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age is 58, which is above the minimum age of 18
- ECOG status is 1, which is acceptable

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has metastatic NSCLC with progressive disease, while the trial requires oligometastatic NSCLC
- Patient has previously received systemic therapy (docetaxel/ramucirumab), while the trial likely expects treatment-naive or first-line patients

**? Uncertainties:**
- Organ function labs (e.g., liver, kidney function) are not provided
- Whether patient has been staged within 3 months prior to registration is not confirmed
- No information on contraindications for EBUS/EUS or ability to provide consent for these procedures

**Assessment:**
> The patient has metastatic NSCLC, which does not match the trial's requirement for oligometastatic disease. Additionally, the patient has received prior systemic therapy, which conflicts with the likely treatment-naive population the trial is targeting.

### [NCT06545331](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06545331)

**A Dose-Escalation and Expansion Study of XB010 as a Single Agent and Combination Therapy in Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors**

- **Sponsor**: Exelixis
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 25%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age is 58, which is above the minimum age of 18
- ECOG performance status is 1
- Cancer type is NSCLC, which is included in the trial conditions

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
