First-line FOLFOX + trastuzumab + pembrolizumab achieved complete response lasting 16 months. Now recurred with peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites requiring paracentesis q2 weeks. Declining appetite and early satiety. Lost 8kg over past 2 months. Seeking next-line options that leverage both HER2 targeting and immunotherapy. Mild hypoalbuminemia (3.1). Family history notable for Lynch syndrome (MLH1 mutation in family, patient confirmed carrier)."
