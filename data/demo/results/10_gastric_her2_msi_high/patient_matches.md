**? Uncertainties:**
- adequate organ function for radiation therapy and immunotherapy
- evaluation by a radiation oncologist within 28 days of study registration

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type, gastric cancer, aligns with the conditions studied in the trial. The patient has undergone prior therapies, which is acceptable as the trial is for previously treated patients. The ECOG status and age meet the criteria. The lack of brain metastases supports eligibility, but uncertainties around organ function and evaluation timeframe exist.

- Patient has received prior systemic therapy and is not treatment-naive, aligning with the trial's requirements for previously treated patients.
- ECOG status is 2, which is acceptable for the trial (0-1 preferred, but not explicitly excluding 2).
- Patient has a measurable lesion, indicated by disease recurrence after first-line treatment.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Need verification of organ function labs such as LVEF, renal function, liver function tests, and blood counts as they are not explicitly stated.
- Need confirmation if the patient has a biopsiable lesion and if they can provide an archival tumor sample.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's advanced gastric cancer and HER2 positivity align well with the trial's targeted indications. The patient has undergone prior systemic therapy, making them eligible for this trial recruiting previously treated patients. While there are some uncertainties regarding organ function and biopsy capabilities, the strong overall match with trial criteria elevates the confidence level.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Measurable disease status** (per RECIST 1.1) - required for most therapeutic trials
- **Life expectancy estimate** - many trials require ≥3 months
- **Cardiac status/QTc interval** - relevant for trials with cardiotoxicity risk
