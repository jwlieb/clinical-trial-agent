      "summary": "This study is a first in human Phase 1 study that involves patients with a type of cancer called HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) positive cancer.\n\nThis study asks patients to volunteer to take part in a research study investigating the safety and efficacy of using special immune cells called HER2 chimeric antigen receptor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (HER2 specific CAR T cells), in combination with intra-tumor injection of CAdVEC, an oncolytic adenovirus that is designed to help the immune system including HER2 specific CAR T cell react to the tumor.\n\nThe study is looking at combining these two treatments together, because we think that the combination of treatments will work better than each treatment alone. We also hope to learn the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.\n\nIn this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor cells.\n\nInvestigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. Both CAdVEC and HER2-specific autologous CAR T are investigational products. They are not approved by the FDA.",

Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. This trial is being done to determine if giving radiation therapy to patients who are being treated with immunotherapy and whose cancers are progressing (getting worse) can slow or stop the growth of their cancers. It may also help researchers determine if giving radiation therapy to one tumor can stimulate the immune system to attack other tumors in the body that are not targeted by the radiation therapy.",

      "summary": "Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) causes chronic cough, throat clearing, hoarseness, and dysphagia and if left untreated can promote the development of laryngeal cancer. More than 20% of the United Stated population suffer from LPR, yet there is no effective medical therapy. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which inhibit gastric acid production but do not prevent reflux events, continue to be prescribed for LPR despite their poor efficacy for this patient population, high cost ($26 billion/year), and associated risks. Pepsin, detected in the airway of these patients and now known to cause laryngeal inflammation and promote disease independent of gastric acid, is a key therapeutic target. We report preclinical studies of select HIV inhibitors that bind to and inhibit pepsin and thus hold promise for the treatment of LPR. In support, a very low incidence of LPR was found in patients taking these drugs compared to the general population. HIV inhibitors are ideal drugs to repurpose because they target a foreign virus. Thus, a repurposing approach can be used to safely perform proof of concept testing of the efficacy of a pepsin inhibitor for LPR. The Specific Aim of this project is to perform a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of fosamprenavirvpills for LPR. Fosamprenavir will be used at the FDA approved, manufacturers recommended dose for HIV for 12 weeks in medically refractory patients with clinically diagnosed moderate/severe LPR and combined multi-channel intraluminal impedance - pH (MII-pH) confirmed laryngeal reflux events. Routine clinical outcome measures for LPR (Reflux Symptom Index, Reflux Finding Score, Voice Handicap Index) will be documented pre- and post-treatment with Oral Fosamprenavir for LPR(n = 52) and placebo (n = 52). Additional research measures will include repeat administration of a newly created Daily Symptom Reflex Diary, as well as an intermittently distributed Patient Global Impression - Static \\& Change scales. There is currently no effective medical therapy for LPR and pepsin is the key therapeutic target. Identification of an FDA approved drug which inhibits pepsin allows for a clinical trial to determine efficacy using a faster and safer repurposing approach to address a significant gap.",

The dose expansion phase (phase Ib) of this trial compares how colorectal and gastroesophageal cancers with HER2 mutation respond to treatment with a combination of ceralasertib and trastuzumab deruxtecan versus trastuzumab deruxtecan alone. Ceralasertib may stop the growth of tumor cells and may kill them by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Ceralasertib and trastuzumab deruxtecan may be safe, tolerable and effective in treating patients with advanced solid tumors expressing the HER2 protein or gene.",

      "summary": "Over the past three decades, the treatment of both primary and secondary liver malignancies has been improved by the development and optimization of multiple minimally invasive thermal ablative therapies. These advances have resulted in a myriad of benefits for patients including decreased morbidity, mortality, as well as increased longevity and quality of life. However, these therapies can only be performed within certain parameters. Thermal ablative techniques such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MVA) are recommended for small lesions under 3 cm due to decreased efficacy when attempting to treat larger lesions. Additionally, large vessels in close proximity to a target lesion may result in heat dissipation, termed the \"heat sink\" effect, and result in incomplete ablation of the lesion. Furthermore, thermal ablative techniques cause off-target damage when utilized near sensitive structures such as the diaphragm, stomach, or bowel, and if performed near thermosensitive bile ducts, can result in cholestasis . Noting these limitations, percutaneous high-dose-rate brachytherapy was brought into clinical practice by Ricke et al. in Europe in 2002 . This therapy utilizes an iridium-192 (192Ir) isotope to administer a cytotoxic dose of radiation to a target lesion. It is not susceptible to heat sink effects and can also deliver radiation with the precision necessary to cause tumor death without destroying the integrity of neighboring structures. Additionally, it can be used to treat larger tumors (\\>3cm) as it is not associated the same size limitations as ablative techniques and can also be utilized to treat lesions that are not amenable to intra-arterial therapies (such as trans-arterial chemoembolization and yttrium-90 radioembolization).\n\nSince its inception, HDRBT has been evaluated through multiple studies investigating its use to treat lesions throughout the body including both primary and secondary liver malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma, metastasis to the liver from colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer , melanoma , and breast cancer . Its use in treating lymph node metastases has also been investigated . These studies have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and clinical effectiveness of this method, establishing it as a therapeutic option when use of thermal ablation therapies is restricted. Most studies however, have been retrospective and have been performed outside the United States.\n\nStudying this therapy will add a crucial treatment option to our current armamentarium, filling a gap in currently available therapies and additionally allowing for further investigation of the use of HDRBT in a larger and more diverse population.",

      "summary": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer: nearly 22,000 women are diagnosed with OC in the US annually and 63% are expected to die from their disease. The 5-year overall survival rate is unacceptably low at 20-30%, with \\> 50% of patients experiencing recurrence of their disease. Recurrent, platinum-resistant OC is characterized by a low response to chemotherapy (\\<10-15%) and poor prognosis, with overall survival estimated to be \\<12 months. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel therapies to improve outcomes for patients with recurrent, platinum resistant OC. The primary focus in this trial is targeting tumor associated immunosuppressive T-regs with E7777 combined with PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab. This trial will enroll patients with solid tumors in the dose escalation portion and specified cohorts in the dose expansion portion. In the Phase I portion, 18-30 patients will be enrolled. In the dose expansion portion, approximately 40 patients (20 in each cohort) will be enrolled. Given the relatively poor prognosis and limited treatment options for these patients, this population is considered appropriate for trials of novel therapeutic candidates.",

Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies and forms of targeted therapy that attach to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab or pertuzumab attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Hyaluronidase is an endoglycosidase. It helps to keep pertuzumab and trastuzumab in the body longer, so that these medications will have a greater effect. Hyaluronidase also allows trastuzumab and trastuzumab/pertuzumab to be given by injection under the skin and shortens their administration time compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab alone. Paclitaxel is a taxane and in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Giving Herceptin Hylecta or Phesgo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin may shrink the tumor and prevent the cancer from coming back in patients with HER2 positive endometrial cancer.",

Patients with peritoneal metastasis have poor survival rates. Traditional surgery is done with a large incision and has a high complication rate and longer hospital stays. Robot assisted (robotic) cytoreduction is a surgical option that uses small incisions and there is less risk of complications. HIPEC involves infusing heated chemotherapy into the abdominal cavity during surgery. Robotic cytoreduction together with HIPEC may improve recovery and decrease complications after surgery.",

      "summary": "This phase Ib trial test effects of aldesleukin in combination with nivolumab and standard chemotherapy in treating patients with gastric cancer that has spread to the tissue lining of the abdomen (peritoneal metastasis). Aldesleukin is similar to a protein that naturally exists in the body that stimulates the immune system to fight infections. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving aldesleukin in combination with nivolumab and standard chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.",

Antibodies are proteins which are naturally produced by the body's immune system to help fight infections. ARX788 consists of antibodies that have been attached to a toxin that has the potential to kill cancer cells. ARX788 sticks to a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), which is found on some breast cancer cells.

Researchers believe that \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 PET imaging may be able to visualize cancer more effectively than the approved tracers.

About 1 hour later, the participant will undergo imaging.\n\nWithin 1 week, participants will undergo the same scanning procedures with the approved tracer.\n\nIf the baseline scan with \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 shows the tumor(s), scans with this tracer will be repeated when their regular treatment regimen calls for scans again. If the scan with the regular FDG also show tumors, this scan will be repeated within the same week as the repeated \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 scan. If \\[18F\\]-FAPi PET scan shows no tumor(s), scans will not be repeated.\n\nIf the participant's cancer progresses within 2 years, scans may be repeated.\n\nFollow-up calls will continue for 2 years.",

Tamoxifen is in a class of medications known as antiestrogens. It blocks the activity of estrogen (a female hormone) in the breast. This may stop the growth of some breast tumors that need estrogen to grow. Aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, prevent the formation of estradiol, a female hormone, by interfering with an aromatase enzyme. Aromatase inhibitors are used as a type of hormone therapy to treat postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer.

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of using lanreotide before surgery to surgery alone in preventing pancreatic fistulas in patients with pancreatic cancer or a pancreatic lesion that could become cancerous. Lanreotide, a type of somatostatin analog similar to somatostatin (a hormone made by the body), and is used to treat certain types of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and carcinoid syndrome. It may help stop the body from making extra amounts of certain hormones, including growth hormone, insulin, glucagon, and hormones that affect digestion. It may also help keep certain types of tumor cells from growing. Patients with pancreatic cancer or pancreatic lesions may undergo surgery to remove parts of the pancreas, also called a distal pancreatectomy. Patients may experience complications after surgery, including pancreatic fistulas. A pancreatic fistula occurs when there is a small leak from the pancreas, causing fluids to collect. This can often lead to infection and other problems. Giving lanreotide before undergoing distal pancreatectomy may be more effective than surgery alone in preventing the development of a pancreatic fistula in patients with pancreatic cancer or a pancreatic lesion that could become cancerous.",
