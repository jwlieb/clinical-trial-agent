However, tumor genotyping can be slow and cumbersome, and is limited by availability of tumor biopsy tissue for testing. The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate a blood-based genotyping tool that can quantify the presence of oncogenic mutations (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF) in patients with lung cancer and melanoma. This assay is being studied both as a diagnostic tool for classifying patient genotype, and a serial measurement tool for quantification of response and progression on therapy.",

      "summary": "Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is a type of cancer that can damage tissue or cause lesions to form in one or more places in the body. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a cancer that begins in LCH cells (a type of dendritic cell which fights infection). Sometimes there are mutations (changes) in LCH cells as they form. These include mutations of the BRAF gene. These changes may make the LCH cells grow and multiply quickly. This causes LCH cells to build up in certain parts of the body, where they can damage tissue or form lesions.\n\nFor most patients with LCH, standard-of-care vinblastine/prednisone are used as front-line therapy while cytarabine therapy has been used as therapy for patients who develop recurrence. No alternate treatment strategy has been developed for frontline therapy in LCH.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to compare previously used vinblastine/prednisone to single therapy with cytarabine for LCH. We will evaluate the utility of an imaging study called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to more accurately assess areas of LCH involvement not otherwise seen in other imaging studies as well as response to therapy. We also want to identify if genetic and other biomarkers (special proteins in patient's blood and in patient's cancer) relate to the response of patients LCH to study treatment.",

Patients included in the registry may include those with: pancreatic cancer, precancerous lesions of the pancreas, inflammatory lesions of the pancreas, cystic lesions of the pancreas, and patients at high-risk of pancreatic cancer such as those with a family history of pancreatic cancer or with a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. However, little is known about the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases in individuals with the above conditions. Knowledge of how family history, environmental exposures, and inflammatory lesion of the pancreas contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases is essential.\n\nYou may qualify to take part in this research study because you have inflammation in the pancreas, a pancreatic cyst, pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas, pancreatic cancer, a family history of pancreatic cancer, or a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer.\n\nWe will also be collecting a blood sample from all participants for DNA isolation. Sometimes we are born with genes or DNA that give us an increased or decreased chance of developing an illness later in life. Genetic material will be isolated from your blood for further study. You may also choose to provide additional blood samples for serum and plasma extraction. Serum and plasma are components of the blood which can be used to measure indicators of disease in the blood, called biomarkers,for pancreatic diseases. Clinical data and biological specimens contained in this study may be used for a wide variety of future related studies to the cause, diagnosis, outcome and treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\nFunds for conducting this research are provided by Mount Sinai.",

      "summary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of modified immune cells (IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells) after a chemotherapy conditioning regimen for the treatment of patients with stage IIIC or IV melanoma or solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic). The study agent is called IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells. T cells are a special type of white blood cell (immune cells) that have the ability to kill tumor cells. The T cells are obtained from the patient's own blood, grown in a laboratory, and modified by adding the IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene. The IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene is inserted into T cells with a virus called a lentivirus. The lentivirus allows cells to make the IL13Ralpha2 CAR protein. This CAR has been designed to bind to a protein on the surface of tumor cells called IL13Ralpha2. This study is being done to determine the dose at which the gene-modified immune cells are safe, how long the cells stay in the body, and if the cells are able to attack the cancer.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of selumetinib versus the standard of care treatment with carboplatin and vincristine (CV) in treating patients with newly diagnosed or previously untreated low-grade glioma (LGG) that does not have a genetic abnormality called BRAFV600E mutation and is not associated with systemic neurofibromatosis type 1. Selumetinib works by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may kill tumor cells. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Vincristine is in a class of medications called vinca alkaloids. It works by stopping tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. The overall goal of this study is to see if selumetinib works just as well as the standard treatment of CV for patients with LGG. Another goal of this study is to compare the effects of selumetinib versus CV in subjects with LGG to find out which is better. Additionally, this trial will also examine if treatment with selumetinib improves the quality of life for subjects who take it.",

      "summary": "This trial compares cryoablation combined with stereotactic body radiation therapy to stereotactic body radiation therapy alone to see how well they work in treating patients with pain from cancer that has spread to the bones (bone metastases). Bone is a common site of metastasis in advanced cancer, and bone metastases often result in debilitating cancer-related pain. The current standard of care to treat painful bone metastases is radiation therapy alone. However, many patients do not get adequate pain relief from radiation therapy alone. Another type of therapy that may be used to provide pain relief from bone metastases is cryoablation. Cryoablation is a procedure in which special needles are inserted into the tumor site. These needles grow ice balls at their tips to freeze and kill cancer cells. The goal of this trial is to compare how well cryoablation in combination with radiation therapy works to radiation therapy alone when given to cancer patients to provide pain relief from bone metastases.",

      "summary": "This collaborative screening protocol, developed by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) and supported by the Thoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG), is designed to determine the feasibility of comprehensive molecular profiling to detect actionable oncogenic drivers in patients with suspected early stage lung cancers scheduled to undergo biopsies to establish the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\nThe primary purpose of this testing is to determine the presence of 12 oncogenic drivers (mutations in EGFR, BRAFV600E , MET exon 14, KRAS G12C and HER2, rearrangements in ALK, RET, NTRK, EGFR exon 20 insertion and ROS1, and amplification of MET and HER2) that can serve as targets making patients eligible for upcoming targeted neoadjuvant therapy trials. The ultimate goal is to use this information from the screening process to select the optimal neoadjuvant therapy and wherever possible enroll patients onto separate neoadjuvant therapy trials with genomically matched treatments or other appropriate trials if no actionable driver mutation is detected.\n\nThoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG) is a network of surgeons within North American Thoracic Surgery Academic Centers aligned with the goal of enhancing patient care through administration of multi-site trials focused on recent advances in lung cancer. TSOG has aligned with the LCMC4 sites to enroll the LCRF-LEADER screening trial. TSOG's involvement will be essential in trial enrollment and ultimate interpretation of the multimodal clinical and translational data collected as part of this study. We estimate we will detect an actionable oncogenic driver in 33% of cases. The remaining 66% of patients will represent a cohort identified by their care teams as candidates for other potential neoadjuvant therapies which may include checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab or other novel agents.\n\nThe targeted therapy treatment trials will be conducted independently of the LCRF-LEADER screening trial, evaluating for efficacy. If none of the 10 oncogenic drivers are detected, the patient will be offered participation in any clinical trial of neoadjuvant therapy available at their treating institution or standard of care therapy. For patients not enrolled on a targeted treatment trial, circulating tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA) will be collected at 3 time points: before neoadjuvant treatment, after neoadjuvant treatment but before surgery, and after surgery. This initiative will be correlated with various clinical outcomes. Prespecified clinical data will be collected for correlation with these circulating biomarkers.",

      "summary": "Over the past three decades, the treatment of both primary and secondary liver malignancies has been improved by the development and optimization of multiple minimally invasive thermal ablative therapies. These advances have resulted in a myriad of benefits for patients including decreased morbidity, mortality, as well as increased longevity and quality of life. However, these therapies can only be performed within certain parameters. Thermal ablative techniques such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MVA) are recommended for small lesions under 3 cm due to decreased efficacy when attempting to treat larger lesions. Additionally, large vessels in close proximity to a target lesion may result in heat dissipation, termed the \"heat sink\" effect, and result in incomplete ablation of the lesion. Furthermore, thermal ablative techniques cause off-target damage when utilized near sensitive structures such as the diaphragm, stomach, or bowel, and if performed near thermosensitive bile ducts, can result in cholestasis . Noting these limitations, percutaneous high-dose-rate brachytherapy was brought into clinical practice by Ricke et al. in Europe in 2002 . This therapy utilizes an iridium-192 (192Ir) isotope to administer a cytotoxic dose of radiation to a target lesion. It is not susceptible to heat sink effects and can also deliver radiation with the precision necessary to cause tumor death without destroying the integrity of neighboring structures. Additionally, it can be used to treat larger tumors (\\>3cm) as it is not associated the same size limitations as ablative techniques and can also be utilized to treat lesions that are not amenable to intra-arterial therapies (such as trans-arterial chemoembolization and yttrium-90 radioembolization).\n\nSince its inception, HDRBT has been evaluated through multiple studies investigating its use to treat lesions throughout the body including both primary and secondary liver malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma, metastasis to the liver from colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer , melanoma , and breast cancer . Its use in treating lymph node metastases has also been investigated . These studies have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and clinical effectiveness of this method, establishing it as a therapeutic option when use of thermal ablation therapies is restricted. Most studies however, have been retrospective and have been performed outside the United States.\n\nStudying this therapy will add a crucial treatment option to our current armamentarium, filling a gap in currently available therapies and additionally allowing for further investigation of the use of HDRBT in a larger and more diverse population.",

This phase evaluated multiple doses of MEM-288 dosed via intratumoral injection once every 3 weeks to assess safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and to determine the MTD.\n\nThe dose expansion phase has multiple parts for advanced NSCLC. Part 1B has completed after evaluation of MEM-288 dosed via intratumoral injection in combination with standard of care nivolumab dosed via intravenous injection.\n\nIn a separate dose expansion arm (Part 1C) that is open for enrollment, patients with advanced NSCLC will be randomized to receive either an initial priming dose of MEM-288 injected into an accessible lesion (s) alone (Day 1) followed by MEM-288 in combination with standard of care docetaxel every 3 weeks up to 6 doses or MEM-288 injected into an accessible lesion(s) in combination with standard of care docetaxel therapy Day 1 and every 3 weeks up to 6 doses.\n\nThe study rationale is that the oncolytic effect of MEM-288 combined with the presence of CD40L and type 1 IFN in injected tumors will provide a strong signal for DC-mediated T cell activation leading to generation of systemic anti-tumor T cell responses with broad specificity akin to what is observed in the abscopal effect.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial studies the good and bad effects of the combination of drugs called cabozantinib and nivolumab in treating patients with melanoma or squamous cell head and neck cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This trial may help doctors determine how quickly patients can be divided into groups based on biomarkers in their tumors. A biomarker is a biological molecule found in the blood, other body fluids, or in tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process or a sign of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition. The two biomarkers that this trial is studying are \"tumor mutational burden\" and \"tumor inflammation signature.\" Another purpose of this trial is to help doctors learn if cabozantinib and nivolumab shrink or stabilize the cancer, and whether patients respond differently to the combination depending on the status of the biomarkers.",

The usual approach for patients is treatment with FOLFOX chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Fluorouracil stops cells from making DNA and it may kill tumor cells. Leucovorin is used with fluorouracil to enhance the effects of the drug. Oxaliplatin works by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Some patients also receive an immunotherapy drug, nivolumab, in addition to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Immunotherapy may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Irinotecan blocks certain enzymes needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill tumor cells. Adding irinotecan to the FOLFOX regimen could shrink the cancer and extend the life of patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancers.",

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a type of disease that occurs when the body makes too many immature Langerhans cells (a type of white blood cell). When these cells build up, they can form tumors in certain tissues and organs including bones, skin, lungs and pituitary gland and can damage them. This tumor is more common in children and young adults. DAY101 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Using DAY101 may be effective in treating patients with relapsed or refractory Langerhans cell histiocytosis.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effects of shorter chemotherapy (chemo)-immunotherapy without anthracyclines to usual chemo-immunotherapy for the treatment of early-stage triple negative breast cancer. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Docetaxel is in a class of medications called taxanes. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline chemotherapy drug that damages DNA and may kill cancer cells. Pembrolizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Shorter treatment without anthracycline chemotherapy may work the same as the usual anthracycline chemotherapy treatment for early-stage triple negative breast cancer.",

      "summary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, best dose, and effectiveness of ZEN003694 in combination with cetuximab and encorafenib in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory), that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed), and that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). ZEN003694 is a protein inhibitor that binds to BET proteins. When ZEN003694 binds to BET proteins, it disrupts gene expression. Preventing the expression of certain growth-promoting genes may inhibit proliferation of tumor cells that over-express BET proteins. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Encorafenib is an enzyme inhibitor. It inhibits pathways that are responsible for controlling cell proliferation and survival, which may lead to a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. Both cetuximab and encorafenib have been approved to treat cancer. Adding ZEN003694 to cetuximab and encorafenib may be more effective at treating patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer than giving the usual treatment (cetuximab and encorafenib) alone.",

For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression\n* Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. Patients should be New York Heart Association Functional Classification of class II or better\n* Patients must have progressed after at least 1 prior systemic treatment for incurable advanced or metastatic disease\n* Patients must have received prior treatment with the combination of encorafenib and cetuximab. They must have tolerated the combination at doses planned for the study\n* The effects of ZEN003694 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because BRD and BET inhibitor agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 4 months following the last dose of study drug. Women must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin \\[HCG\\]) within 72 hours prior to the start of investigational product.

Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694. As proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 receptor antagonists, and antacids may alter the pharmacokinetics of ZEN003694 by reducing ZEN003694 exposure, patients receiving proton pump inhibitors are ineligible. If H2 blockers or other acid reducing agents are used concomitantly with ZEN003694, a staggered dosing schedule should be used, either dose ZEN003694 2 hours before the H2 blocker or 10-12 hours after an H2 blocker. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZEN003694 is BRD and BET inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ZEN003694, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ZEN003694. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study",

      "summary": "This early-phase study will examine Vusolimogene Oderparepvec, a genetically modified oncolytic viral strain of the herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) virus, with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, vusolimogene oderparepvec specifically targets, infects and replicates in tumor cells and does not infect healthy cells. This results in tumor cell lysis and the release of virus particles which infect and replicate within nearby tumor cells, resulting in tumor cel death. The immune system is activated by the released tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) from the tumor cells creating an anti-tumor immune response against the tumor cells, thereby further killing the tumor cells. The virus itself also elicits a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the impact of subcutaneous (SC) nivolumab given in an in-home setting to an in-clinic setting on cancer care and quality of life. Currently, most drug-related cancer care is conducted in clinic type centers or hospitals which may isolate patients from family, friends and familiar surroundings for many hours per day. This separation adds to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families. Traveling to and from medical facilities costs time, money, and effort and can be a disadvantage to patients living in rural areas, those with low incomes or poor access to transport. Studies have shown that cancer patients often feel more comfortable and secure being cared for in their own home environments. SC nivolumab in-home treatment may be safe, tolerable and/or effective when compared to in-clinic treatment and may reduce the burden of cancer and improve the quality of life in cancer patients.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of cabozantinib versus combination dabrafenib and trametinib for the treatment of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer that does not respond to treatment (refractory) and which expresses a BRAF V600E mutation. Cabozantinib is in a class of medications called receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It binds to and blocks the action of several enzymes which are often over-expressed in a variety of tumor cell types. This may help stop or slow the growth of tumor cells and blood vessels the tumor needs to survive. Dabrafenib is an enzyme inhibitor that binds to and inhibits the activity of a protein called B-raf, which may inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells which contain a mutated BRAF gene. Trametinib is also an enzyme inhibitor. It binds to and inhibits the activity of proteins called MEK 1 and 2, which play a key role in activating pathways that regulate cell growth. This may inhibit the growth of tumor cells mediated by these pathways. The usual approach for patients with thyroid cancer is targeted therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib. This trial may help researchers decide which treatment option (cabozantinib alone or dabrafenib in combination with trametinib) is safer and/or more effective in treating patients with refractory BRAF V600E-mutated differentiated thyroid cancer.",

The important benefit of the Cytophone diagnosis is that the test does not require injection or any skin incision (i.e., non-invasiveness). The goal of this clinical trial is to demonstrate evidence of the capability of the Cytophone test to indicate a risk of metastasis and define CTC counts that correlate with melanoma recurrence, progression of metastatic disease, and therapy efficacy.

Narrow margin excision removes a smaller amount of healthy tissue when surgically removing the melanoma. Narrow margin excision may be effective in removing the melanoma while also reducing surgical complications and improving quality of life for adults with invasive cutaneous melanoma.",

Unfortunately, some BRAF-altered gliomas can progress or have rebound growth after discontinuation of therapy. Data from BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma has shown potential synergy between MAPK inhibition and anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD1) checkpoint blockade. Anti-PD1 therapy, such as, nivolumab can block the PD1 receptor on T cells, a marker of T cell exhaustion, allowing a continued or more robust anti-tumor immune response. Here, investigators will combine MAPK inhibition with anti-PD1 therapy in recurrent, refractory low grade BRAF-altered glioma and newly diagnosed or recurrent BRAF-altered or NF-altered high grade glioma.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of adding radiation therapy to usual care on the occurrence of bone-related complications in cancer patients with high-risk bone metastases that are not causing symptoms (asymptomatic). High-risk bone metastases are defined by their location (including hip, shoulder, long bones, and certain levels of the spine), or size (2 cm or larger). These bone metastases appear to be at higher risk of complications such as fracture, spinal cord compression, and/or pain warranting surgery or radiation treatment. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. The total dose of radiation can be delivered in a single day or divided in smaller doses for up to 5 days of total treatment. Usual care for asymptomatic bone metastases may include drugs that prevent bone loss, in addition to the treatment for the primary cancer or observation (which means no treatment until symptoms appear). Evidence has shown that preventative radiation therapy may be effective in lowering the number of bone metastases-related complications, however, it is not known if this approach is superior to usual care. Adding radiation therapy to usual care may be more effective in preventing bone-related complications than usual care alone in cancer patients with asymptomatic high-risk bone metastases.",

This is sometimes followed by a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, in which lymph nodes that cancer cells could spread to are removed as well.\n\nWe are doing this study because we want to find out if performing the WLE alone is just as effective as the usual approach for your melanoma, and if it leads to improvements in patients' overall well-being. The usual approach is defined as care most people get for the early stage of melanoma that you currently have.",
