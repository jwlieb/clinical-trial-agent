## 🟡 MEDIUM Likelihood (3 trials)

### [NCT05786924](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05786924)

**A Phase 1/2, Open-label Study of Oral S241656 (BDTX-4933) as Monotherapy and in Combination With Other Anti-Cancer Therapies in Patients With KRAS, BRAF and Other Selected RAS/MAPK Mutation-Positive Malignancies**

- **Sponsor**: Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier
- **Phase**: Phase 1/Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has melanoma which is a solid tumor.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Trial primarily targets NSCLC and not melanoma; thus does not fully match the disease indication.
- Patient has prior systemic therapies and the trial includes treatment-naive or previously treated indication ambiguity.

**? Uncertainties:**
- No information on specific organ function parameters.
- It is unclear if the trial explicitly accepts melanoma as an eligible solid tumor in the absence of NSCLC.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type partially aligns with the trial conditions as BRAF V600E mutation is specified, but melanoma is not the primary focus of the trial, which is for NSCLC and other specific malignancies. There are also uncertainties regarding treatment line and organ function, which affect overall eligibility assessment.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Whether patient has a plan for re-biopsy for resistance genotyping.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's disease type (melanoma) matches the trial's focus, particularly with the BRAF V600E mutation. However, the patient has had multiple prior therapies, which puts her into a different treatment line than what the trial specifies, which potentially limits eligibility. The presence of a plan for potential re-biopsy for resistance genotyping is also unclear.

### [NCT03743298](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03743298)

**Phase 1B Trial of AV-MEL-1 (Autologous Dendritic Cells Loaded With Autologous Tumor Antigens) With Anti-PD-1 Checkpoint Inhibitors in Metastatic Melanoma**

- **Sponsor**: Aivita Biomedical, Inc.
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 30%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age > 18
- ECOG status 0
- PD-L1 60%
- Metastatic melanoma diagnosis

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has received multiple prior therapies (not treatment-naive)
- Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) has not been explicitly provided

**? Uncertainties:**
- Presence of at least one metastatic lesion that is to be surgically removed is unclear
- Patient's KPS is unspecified (could be < 70)

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial's indication; however, the patient has received prior systemic therapies, making her ineligible if the trial is for treatment-naive patients. There are uncertainties due to lack of clarity on KPS and the resection of a metastatic lesion.

### [NCT05053555](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05053555)

**High Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for the Treatment of Both Primary and Secondary Unresectable Liver Malignancies**

- **Sponsor**: M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
- **Phase**: Not Applicable
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 25%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age is 45, which is above the required minimum of 18
- ECOG status is 0

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has melanoma, but trial focuses on liver malignancies. This may conflict with their eligibility depending on the specific criteria defined for the inclusion of melanoma patients.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Specific details about liver lesions or metastases are not provided, making it unclear if the patient has up to five unresectable tumors that meet the size and proximity criteria.
- Missing lab results for total serum bilirubin, platelet count, and INR, which are crucial for determining eligibility.

**Assessment:**
> The patient has melanoma, but the trial is targeting liver malignancies, which raises significant eligibility concerns. The absence of specific details about liver lesions and lab results further adds to uncertainties. Overall, the mismatch in cancer type and missing critical information leads to a low confidence in eligibility.

### [NCT02339571](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02339571)

**Randomized Phase II/III Study of Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab Plus Sargramostim Versus Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in Patients With Unresectable Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma**

- **Sponsor**: National Cancer Institute (NCI)
- **Phase**: Phase 2/Phase 3
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 20%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age: 45
- Sex: female
- Cancer type: melanoma
- Biomarkers: BRAF V600E
- ECOG status: 0
- PD-L1: 60%
- No brain metastases

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has received nivolumab and ipilimumab in prior therapies, trial excludes patients who have had anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or ipilimumab in the metastatic setting.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Location does not affect eligibility as the patient is from the United States, which is within the trial region.
- Blood work results for white blood count, ANC, platelet count, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and LDH are not provided.

**Assessment:**
> Patient's cancer type matches the trial, but she has previously received anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 agents in the metastatic setting, which leads to exclusion from the trial. Other aspects of eligibility could not be verified without more information.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Measurable disease status** (per RECIST 1.1) - required for most therapeutic trials
