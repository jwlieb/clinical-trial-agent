Developed lung and subcutaneous metastases 8 months later. First-line dabrafenib/trametinib achieved partial response but progressed at 14 months. Second-line nivolumab/ipilimumab combination - mixed response, eventually progressed with new splenic lesions. Currently well-appearing with good functional status. LDH elevated (312). Looking for novel combinations or emerging targets. No brain mets on most recent MRI."
