      "summary": "The purpose of this study is to establish a registry of patients with pancreatic diseases. Patients included in the registry may include those with: pancreatic cancer, precancerous lesions of the pancreas, inflammatory lesions of the pancreas, cystic lesions of the pancreas, and patients at high-risk of pancreatic cancer such as those with a family history of pancreatic cancer or with a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. However, little is known about the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases in individuals with the above conditions. Knowledge of how family history, environmental exposures, and inflammatory lesion of the pancreas contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases is essential.\n\nYou may qualify to take part in this research study because you have inflammation in the pancreas, a pancreatic cyst, pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas, pancreatic cancer, a family history of pancreatic cancer, or a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer.\n\nWe will also be collecting a blood sample from all participants for DNA isolation. Sometimes we are born with genes or DNA that give us an increased or decreased chance of developing an illness later in life. Genetic material will be isolated from your blood for further study. You may also choose to provide additional blood samples for serum and plasma extraction. Serum and plasma are components of the blood which can be used to measure indicators of disease in the blood, called biomarkers,for pancreatic diseases. Clinical data and biological specimens contained in this study may be used for a wide variety of future related studies to the cause, diagnosis, outcome and treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\nFunds for conducting this research are provided by Mount Sinai.",

      "summary": "This phase I trial investigates the side effects and best dose of talazoparib when given together with trifluridine/tipiracil for the treatment of patients with colorectal or gastroesophageal cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic). Drugs used in the chemotherapy, such as trifluridine/tipiracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Talazoparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving talazoparib with trifluridine/ tipiracil may inhibit certain enzymes in the cells that are responsible for tumor cell growth.",

      "summary": "This collaborative screening protocol, developed by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) and supported by the Thoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG), is designed to determine the feasibility of comprehensive molecular profiling to detect actionable oncogenic drivers in patients with suspected early stage lung cancers scheduled to undergo biopsies to establish the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\nThe primary purpose of this testing is to determine the presence of 12 oncogenic drivers (mutations in EGFR, BRAFV600E , MET exon 14, KRAS G12C and HER2, rearrangements in ALK, RET, NTRK, EGFR exon 20 insertion and ROS1, and amplification of MET and HER2) that can serve as targets making patients eligible for upcoming targeted neoadjuvant therapy trials. The ultimate goal is to use this information from the screening process to select the optimal neoadjuvant therapy and wherever possible enroll patients onto separate neoadjuvant therapy trials with genomically matched treatments or other appropriate trials if no actionable driver mutation is detected.\n\nThoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG) is a network of surgeons within North American Thoracic Surgery Academic Centers aligned with the goal of enhancing patient care through administration of multi-site trials focused on recent advances in lung cancer. TSOG has aligned with the LCMC4 sites to enroll the LCRF-LEADER screening trial. TSOG's involvement will be essential in trial enrollment and ultimate interpretation of the multimodal clinical and translational data collected as part of this study. We estimate we will detect an actionable oncogenic driver in 33% of cases. The remaining 66% of patients will represent a cohort identified by their care teams as candidates for other potential neoadjuvant therapies which may include checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab or other novel agents.\n\nThe targeted therapy treatment trials will be conducted independently of the LCRF-LEADER screening trial, evaluating for efficacy. If none of the 10 oncogenic drivers are detected, the patient will be offered participation in any clinical trial of neoadjuvant therapy available at their treating institution or standard of care therapy. For patients not enrolled on a targeted treatment trial, circulating tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA) will be collected at 3 time points: before neoadjuvant treatment, after neoadjuvant treatment but before surgery, and after surgery. This initiative will be correlated with various clinical outcomes. Prespecified clinical data will be collected for correlation with these circulating biomarkers.",

      "summary": "Over the past three decades, the treatment of both primary and secondary liver malignancies has been improved by the development and optimization of multiple minimally invasive thermal ablative therapies. These advances have resulted in a myriad of benefits for patients including decreased morbidity, mortality, as well as increased longevity and quality of life. However, these therapies can only be performed within certain parameters. Thermal ablative techniques such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MVA) are recommended for small lesions under 3 cm due to decreased efficacy when attempting to treat larger lesions. Additionally, large vessels in close proximity to a target lesion may result in heat dissipation, termed the \"heat sink\" effect, and result in incomplete ablation of the lesion. Furthermore, thermal ablative techniques cause off-target damage when utilized near sensitive structures such as the diaphragm, stomach, or bowel, and if performed near thermosensitive bile ducts, can result in cholestasis . Noting these limitations, percutaneous high-dose-rate brachytherapy was brought into clinical practice by Ricke et al. in Europe in 2002 . This therapy utilizes an iridium-192 (192Ir) isotope to administer a cytotoxic dose of radiation to a target lesion. It is not susceptible to heat sink effects and can also deliver radiation with the precision necessary to cause tumor death without destroying the integrity of neighboring structures. Additionally, it can be used to treat larger tumors (\\>3cm) as it is not associated the same size limitations as ablative techniques and can also be utilized to treat lesions that are not amenable to intra-arterial therapies (such as trans-arterial chemoembolization and yttrium-90 radioembolization).\n\nSince its inception, HDRBT has been evaluated through multiple studies investigating its use to treat lesions throughout the body including both primary and secondary liver malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma, metastasis to the liver from colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer , melanoma , and breast cancer . Its use in treating lymph node metastases has also been investigated . These studies have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and clinical effectiveness of this method, establishing it as a therapeutic option when use of thermal ablation therapies is restricted. Most studies however, have been retrospective and have been performed outside the United States.\n\nStudying this therapy will add a crucial treatment option to our current armamentarium, filling a gap in currently available therapies and additionally allowing for further investigation of the use of HDRBT in a larger and more diverse population.",

HAI uses a catheter to carry a tumor-killing chemotherapy drug called floxuridine directly into the liver. HAI is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver, but it is only available at a small number of hospitals, and most of the time it is not used until standard chemotherapy stops working. Standard chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Adding HAI to standard chemotherapy may be effective in shrinking or stabilizing unresectable colorectal liver metastases.",

      "summary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of carfilzomib in combination with sotorasib in treating patients with KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Carfilzomib is a drug that binds to and inhibits the activity of the protein complex that is responsible for degrading other damaged or unneeded proteins. The inhibition of this protein by carfilzomib can then cause tumor growth inhibition and cell death. Sotorasib is a drug that binds to and inhibits the activity of the KRAS G12C mutant. This may inhibit growth in KRAS G12C-expressing tumor cells. Combining carfilzomib and sotorasib may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the impact of subcutaneous (SC) nivolumab given in an in-home setting to an in-clinic setting on cancer care and quality of life. Currently, most drug-related cancer care is conducted in clinic type centers or hospitals which may isolate patients from family, friends and familiar surroundings for many hours per day. This separation adds to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families. Traveling to and from medical facilities costs time, money, and effort and can be a disadvantage to patients living in rural areas, those with low incomes or poor access to transport. Studies have shown that cancer patients often feel more comfortable and secure being cared for in their own home environments. SC nivolumab in-home treatment may be safe, tolerable and/or effective when compared to in-clinic treatment and may reduce the burden of cancer and improve the quality of life in cancer patients.",

Iadademstat inhibits the LSD1 protein and may lead to inhibition of cell growth in LSD1-overexpressing cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Giving iadademstat with azacitidine and venetoclax may be safe, tolerable and/or effective in treating patients with newly diagnosed AML who cannot undergo intensive chemotherapy.",

The biopsies are samples of tissue, about the size of a grain of rice, that will be taken from the colon or rectum before and after taking the study medications. This is done during a usual, clinical colonoscopy exam and during one more limited exam, called flexible sigmoidoscopy, that is done for the research study. The flexible sigmoidoscopy requires less preparation. Which procedure comes first depends on what fits best with each participant's clinical scenario.

Pancreas is a long, flat gland that lies in the abdomen behind the stomach. Pancreas creates enzymes that help with digestion. It also makes hormones that can help control your blood sugar levels.\n\nAll participants in this study will take the study medication (PF-07934040) as pill by mouth twice a day repeating for 21-day or 28-day cycles.\n\nDepending on which part of the study participants are enrolled into they will receive the study medication (PF-07934040 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer medications). These anti-cancer medications will be given in the study clinic by intravenous (IV) that is directly injected into the veins at various times (depending on the treatment) during the 21-day or 28-day cycle.\n\nParticipants can continue to take the study medication (PF-07934040) and the combination anti-cancer therapy until their cancer is no longer responding.\n\nThe study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help see if the study medicines are safe and effective.\n\nParticipants will be involved in this study for up to 4 years. During this time, they will come into the clinic between 1 to 4 times in each 21-day or 28-day cycle. After they have stopped taking the study medication (at about at 2 years) they will be followed for another two years to see how they are doing.",
