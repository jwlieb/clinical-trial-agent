Previously treated with BR (bendamustine/rituximab) x6 cycles, then ibrutinib x3 years with eventual progression. Venetoclax initiated but discontinued after 4 months due to tumor lysis syndrome requiring hospitalization. Now with progressive lymphadenopathy and cytopenias (ANC 0.8, Hgb 8.9, Plt 67k). Limited by fatigue and reduced mobility - uses walker, needs assistance with ADLs. Multiple comorbidities: CHF (EF 35%), afib on anticoagulation, T2DM, CKD stage 3b."
