Applying these methods in a natural history study can help identify processes involved in disease progression, and possibly lead to the discovery or validation of treatment targets.\n\nObjectives\n\nStudy the history of MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL in patients prior to and after treatment. Characterize clinical, biologic and molecular events of disease stability and progression of patients enrolled on this protocol.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Diagnosis of CLL/SLL and on treatment/previously treated/nearing treatment\n* Diagnosis of LPL/WM\n* As of February 5, 2025, patients with MBL and SMZL will no longer be enrolled.\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status of 0-2.\n\nDesign\n\nPatients are typically followed every 6 to 24 months in the clinic and have blood drawn. Patients may be asked to undergo additional testing, including bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, lymph node biopsy, positron emission tomography, and CT and MRI scans. Some of these tests (e.g., blood draw) may be required to monitor CLL/SLL and LPL/WM. Other tests (e.g., lymph node biopsy) may not be clinically indicated, but patients may be asked to undergo these procedures for research purposes.\n\nNo treatment will be administered on this study. If a patients requires treatment for their cancer, available NIH clinical trials and alternative treatment options will be discussed with the patient.",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Ponatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving acalabrutinib with or without obinutuzumab will work better in treating patients with early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.",

Screening is not required.\n* History of a serious bleeding disorder unrelated to ALL.\n* It is suggested that participants receiving treatment with medications that meet one of the following criteria discontinue the relevant drug prior to the start of treatment with ASCIMINIB and for the duration of the study. If the medication is medically necessary, review with PI before enrollment.\n\n  * Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5.\n  * Moderate and strong inhibitors CYP3A4/5.\n  * CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 substrates with narrow therapeutic index. All other substrates of the enzymes should be used with caution.\n  * H2 antagonists/proton-pump inhibitors.\n  * Grapefruit products are not permitted while on study.\n  * Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information.\n\nAs part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.\n\n* Corrected QT interval (QTc) of \\> 480 milliseconds (ms) on baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) (using corrected QT interval per institutional standard).\n* Major surgery within 2 weeks before the first dose of ASCIMINIB.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Uncontrolled infection.\n  * Unstable cardiovascular condition including symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA class 3 or 4), unstable angina pectoris, ongoing clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia uncontrolled by medication, and myocardial infarction or stroke within the past 3 months.\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n  * Currently requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and/or hemodialysis (life-support).\n  * History of significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer.\n* Unable to comply with an oral regimen.\n* Are pregnant or nursing at the time of screening. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ASCIMINIB is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ASCIMINIB, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ASCIMINIB. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. Urine or serum pregnancy test must be performed within 14 days of Day 1 for women of childbearing potential.",

Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient, they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated stem cells may also replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells.",

Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab early (before patients have symptoms) may have better outcomes for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma compared to starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab after patients show symptoms.",

For subjects who have required surgical intervention for any above diseases within the past 6 months, a discussion with the Investigator and the Medical Monitor is needed.\n6. Subject has baseline prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT (QTcF) interval \u2265 480 ms (calculated per Fridericia's formula \\[QTcF = QT/RR (1/3)\\])), a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class \u2265 2 or associated other significant screening ECG or ultrasonic cardiogram abnormalities, per Investigator's judgement. For any subject with underlying RBBB or LBBB, cardiology review is needed to correct QTcF calculation using Sponsor recommended formula.\n7. Subject has significant a history of congenital long QT syndrome or Torsades de Pointes (TdP), uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to the first dose of LP-118.\n8. Subject exhibits evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including, but not limited to:\n\n   * Uncontrolled active systemic infection (bacterial, fungal, viral);\n   * Known poorly controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B or C infection (active hepatitis B defined as HbsAg positive, or HbcAb positive with detectable HBV DNA load; active hepatitis C defined as HCV antibody positive with HCV RNA positive);\n   * Unexplained fever \\> 38.5\u00b0C within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug administration (at the discretion of the Investigator if the fever is considered attributed to the subject's malignancy or an explained infection may be enrolled).\n9. A female subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.\n10. Subject incapacity to swallow oral medications, with any malabsorption condition, known dysphagia, short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may limit the ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs administered orally.\n11. Subjects with known and active central nervous system (CNS) involvement at Screening.\n12. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of LP-118 (see Investigators Brochure for a list of components).\n13. Subjects who are taking QT-prolonging drugs that are known to cause Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (See Appendix 17 for the list of medications that are associated with TdP). In the event a prohibited medication might cause TdP, the PI must first determine if the risk to benefit is in favor of the subject and then discuss with the Medical Monitor about that particular medication on a case-by-case basis.\n14. Major surgery within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.",

      "summary": "Metabolic reprogramming has been identified as a hallmark of cancer. Almost a century after Otto Warburg initially discovered increased glycolytic activity in tumor tissue (\"Warburg effect\"), therapeutic targeting of cancer metabolism has become a field of intense research effort in cancer biology.\n\nA growing appreciation of metabolic heterogeneity and complexity is currently reshaping investigators \"simplistic\" understanding of metabolic reprogramming in cancer. Discovering metabolic vulnerabilities as new treatment targets for cancer requires systematic dissection of metabolic dependencies, fuel preferences, and underlying mechanisms in the specific physiological context. However, today's data on cancer cell metabolic signatures and heterogeneity in their physiological habitat of the human organism is sparse to non-existent representing a critical knowledge gap in designing effective metabolic therapies. Here, the investigators propose a \"top-down\" approach studying cancer cell metabolism in patients followed by mechanistic in-depth studies in cell culture and animal models to define metabolic vulnerabilities.\n\nInvestigators will develop a metabolic tracing method to quantitatively characterize metabolic signatures and fuel preferences of leukemic lymphocytes in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Isotopic metabolic tracers are nutrients that are chemically identical to the native nutrient. Incorporated stable, non-radioactive isotopes allow investigators to follow their metabolic fate by monitoring conversion of tracer nutrients into downstream metabolites using cutting-edge metabolomics analysis. Using this method, investigators propose to test the hypothesis that leukemic lymphocytes show tissue-specific metabolic preferences that differ from non-leukemic lymphocytes and that ex vivo in-plasma labeling represents a useful model for assaying metabolic activity in leukemic cells in a patient-specific manner.",

Higher amounts of body fat is associated with resistance to chemotherapy in patients with B-ALL. Chemotherapy during the first month causes large gains in body fat in most people, even those who start chemotherapy at a healthy weight.\n\nThis study is being done to find out if caloric restriction achieved by a personalized nutritional menu and exercise plan during routine chemotherapy can make the patient's ALL more sensitive to chemotherapy and also reduce the amount of body fat gained during treatment. The goals of this study are to help make chemotherapy more effective in treating the patient's leukemia as demonstrated by fewer patients with leukemia minimal residual disease (MRD) while also trying to reduce the amount of body fat that chemotherapy causes the patient to gain in the first month.",

      "summary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects and best infusion dose of genetically engineered cells called anti-CD19/CD20/CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells following a short course of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine in treating patients with lymphoid cancers (malignancies) that have come back (recurrent) or do not respond to treatment (refractory). Lymphoid malignancies eligible for this trial are: non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and B-prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL). T-cells (a type of white blood cell) form part of the body's immune system. CAR-T is a type of cell therapy that is used with gene-based therapies. CAR T-cells are made by taking a patient's own T-cells and genetically modifying them with a virus so that they are recognized by a group of proteins called CD19/CD20/CD22 which are found on the surface of cancer cells. Anti-CD19/CD20/CD22 CAR T-cells can recognize CD19/CD20/CD22, bind to the cancer cells and kill them. Giving combination chemotherapy helps prepare the body before CAR T-cell therapy. Giving CAR-T after cyclophosphamide and fludarabine may kill more tumor cells.",

This will include:\n\nPhysical exam\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\nTests of their lung and heart function\n\nImaging scans\n\nBone marrow biopsy. A large needle will be inserted into the body to draw some tissues from the interior of a bone.\n\nLumbar puncture. A needle will be inserted into the lower back to draw fluid from the area around the spinal cord.\n\nParticipants will undergo apheresis. Their blood will circulate through a machine that separates blood into different parts. The portion containing T cells will be collected; the remaining cells and fluids will be returned to the body. The T cells will be changed in a laboratory to make them better at fighting cancer cells.\n\nParticipants will receive chemotherapy starting 4 or 5 days before the CAR treatment.\n\nParticipants will be admitted to the hospital.

Anti-CD20 therapy may not be required for all patients. The investigators hypothesis is that it may be better to give anti-CD20 therapy (obinutuzumab) only to patients that still have detectable cancer in their blood (minimal residual disease \\[MRD\\]) after being treated with a combination of two oral medications, zanubrutinib (a BTKi ) and venetoclax (a BCL-2i), instead of giving a combination of three drugs to all patients from the start of treatment. This strategy, if effective, will prevent overtreatment with anti-CD20 antibodies; reduce side effects of treatment while potentially increasing MRD negativity rates; and will possibly make the anti-CD20 antibody therapy more effective given the low tumor burden present when utilized. This study will test this hypothesis by treating subjects with 3 cycles of a zanubrutinib monotherapy lead-in, in order to debulk and mitigate tumor lysis risk, followed by 13 cycles of zanubrutinib and venetoclax combination therapy. Subjects who are both peripheral blood and bone marrow MRD negative at the completion of the 13 cycles of combination therapy will stop treatment and enter an observation phase every 3 months. Subjects that are MRD positive will continue combination therapy with zanubrutinib and venetoclax for an additional 6 cycles but also receive 6 cycles of obinutuzumab in order to augment response and increase MRD negative rates for the overall treated cohort.",

Loncastuximab tesirine is a monoclonal antibody, loncastuximab, linked to a toxic agent called tesirine. Loncastuximab attaches to anti-CD19 cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers tesirine to kill them. Mosunetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving loncastuximab tesirine with mosunetuzumab may help treat patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",

Approximately 340 adult participants with multiple NHL subtypes will be enrolled in the study in sites world wide.\n\nIn the Dose Escalation phase of the study participants will receive escalating oral doses of ABBV-101, until the MAD/MTD is determined, as part of the approximately 88 month study duration. In the dose expansion phase of the study participants receive oral ABBV-101, as part of the approximately 88 month study duration .\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital or clinic).

Most newly-diagnosed CLL patients have early-stage disease at the time of diagnosis and do not require treatment. Despite not needing therapy, these patients have significant immune dysfunction. This may lead to an increased risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization and an increased risk of secondary non-blood-based (hematologic) cancers. Increasing CLL patients overall physical fitness levels, through exercise during the observation stage, may provide a realistic approach means to increase survival, decrease treatment-related side effects, and improve immune function. Information learned from this study may help researchers determine whether a particular exercise regimen can be used to strengthen the immune system of indolent NHL and CLL patients, delay time to disease progression, assess the need for treatment, and assess infection rates.",

Odronextamab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that can bind to two different antigens at the same time. Odronextamab binds to CD20 found on B-cells (a type of white blood cell) and on many B-cell cancers and to CD3 on T-cells (also a type of white blood cell) and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.

T cells are taken from a patient's blood, in this study, the T cells are cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein, CD19, on the patient's cancer cells is added to the CMV-specific T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a CAR. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Vaccines made from three CMV tumor associated antigens, may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Giving allogeneic CMV-specific CD19-CAR T cells plus CMV-MVA vaccine after matched related alloHSCT may be safe, tolerable, and/or effective in treating patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

Acalabrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It blocks a protein called BTK, which is present on B-cell (a type of white blood cells) cancers at abnormal levels. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and spreading. CLL/SLL patients treated with a different BTK inhibitor called ibrutinib often experience cardiac side effects, leading to discontinuation of life-saving therapy. Treatment with acalabrutinib after discontinuing, or even before starting, treatment with ibrutinib may reverse or prevent cardiac side effects and be an effective treatment option for patients with CLL/SLL.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial studies how well vedolizumab plus post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and short course tacrolimus work for the prevention of graft versus host disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after reduced intensity conditioning. Allogeneic HCT is a procedure in which a person receives blood-forming stem cells (cells from which all blood cells develop) from a donor. Giving reduced conditioning chemotherapy before an allogeneic HCT helps kill cancer cells in the body and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new stem cells to grow using less than standard doses of chemotherapy. Sometimes, the transplanted cells from a donor can attack the body's normal cells (called graft-versus-host disease). Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody, which is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). It may reduce inflammation. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Tacrolimus suppresses the immune system by preventing the activation of certain types of immune cells. Giving vedolizumab plus PTCy and short course tacrolimus may be effective at preventing GVHD after allogeneic HCT.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial studies the side effects of an escalated ramp-up of sonrotoclax following initial debulking with zanubrutinib or rituximab in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) that is newly diagnosed, has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B-cells, and may kill tumor cells. Zanubrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking a protein called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is needed for tumor cell growth. Sonrotoclax works by blocking a protein called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2). This protein helps certain types of blood tumor cells to survive and grow. When sonrotoclax blocks Bcl-2 it slows down or stops the growth of tumor cells and helps them die. Giving an increased dose of sonrotoclax over a shorter period of time in combination with zanubrutinib or rituximab may be safe and tolerable in treating patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory CLL, SLL, and MCL.",

      "summary": "This phase I trial tests zanubrutinib in combination with sonrotoclax for treating underrepresented ethnic and racial minorities with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Many racial and ethnic minorities face additional treatment challenges which may lead to poorer outcomes, however, there are fewer racial and ethnic minorities participating in clinical trials. Zanubrutinib, a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocks a protein called Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), which may help keep cancer cells from growing. Sonrotoclax works by blocking a protein called B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). This protein helps certain types of blood cancer cells to survive and grow. When sonrotoclax blocks Bcl-2, it slows down or stops the growth of cancer cells and causes them to die. Zanubrutinib and sonrotoclax have been shown to be an effective treatment for B-cell cancers. Giving zanubrutinib in combination with sonrotoclax may be effective in treating ethnic and racial minorities with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests how well nemtabrutinib in combination with pembrolizumab works in treating patients with Richter transformation, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtype (RT-DLBCL). Nemtabrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It blocks a protein called BTK, which is present on B-cells (a type of white blood cell) in cancers such as Richter transformation at abnormal levels. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving nemtabrutinib in combination with pembrolizumab may kill more cancer cells in patients with RT-DLBCL.",

Responses are more limited in CLL/SLL, possibly secondary to the suppressive effect of circulating B cells on T cell function.\n\nBAFF receptor is a target that has been explored in CLL. Preclinical data indicates that CAR- T cells expressing B-cell activating factor (BAFF) can be another effective strategy to treat refractory CLL.

Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because LMY-920 therapy may be associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LMY-920, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n13.

CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein, such as CD19, CD20 and CD22, on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a CAR. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers.

Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Obinutuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Epcoritamab, a bispecific monoclonal antibody, binds to a protein called CD3, which is found on T cells (a type of white blood cell). It also binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (another type of white blood cell) and some lymphoma cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. The combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab is a standard treatment for CLL/SLL and has been found to be safe and effective. Adding epcoritamab to standard treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab may lead to deeper and longer-lasting responses in patients with untreated CLL/SLL.",
