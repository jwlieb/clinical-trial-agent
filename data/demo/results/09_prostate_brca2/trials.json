Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. However, little is known about the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases in individuals with the above conditions. Knowledge of how family history, environmental exposures, and inflammatory lesion of the pancreas contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases is essential.\n\nYou may qualify to take part in this research study because you have inflammation in the pancreas, a pancreatic cyst, pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas, pancreatic cancer, a family history of pancreatic cancer, or a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer.\n\nWe will also be collecting a blood sample from all participants for DNA isolation. Sometimes we are born with genes or DNA that give us an increased or decreased chance of developing an illness later in life. Genetic material will be isolated from your blood for further study. You may also choose to provide additional blood samples for serum and plasma extraction. Serum and plasma are components of the blood which can be used to measure indicators of disease in the blood, called biomarkers,for pancreatic diseases. Clinical data and biological specimens contained in this study may be used for a wide variety of future related studies to the cause, diagnosis, outcome and treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\nFunds for conducting this research are provided by Mount Sinai.",

Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy.",

Patients at all stages of disease will be welcome to participate in the PROMISE Registry.\n\nParticipants will be recruited \\& screened over a five-year period. Study participants will be asked to provide a saliva sample to be tested for germline cancer risk variants through Color Health. If the results identify a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, an appointment with a genetic counselor from Color Health will be scheduled to discuss the results.\n\nParticipants will complete a baseline demographic survey that includes self-reported health history, family history of cancer and standardized patient reported outcome (PRO) measures.\n\nPROMISE Registry staff will request medical records from the participant's cancer care provider(s) for the purpose of obtaining clinical data.\n\nParticipants will receive bi-annual newsletters offering information on new developments in treatment and research opportunities, including clinical trials, associated with genetic variants.\n\nEligible participants (those with target germline mutations) will be followed every 6 months to obtain updated health records data and patient-reported outcomes data. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 15 years.\n\nThe PROMISE registry will help identify prostate cancer patients with pathogenic variants to learn more about how these variants affect patient outcomes. Ultimately, we hope to help patients learn more about their disease and the treatments that they may derive the most benefit from, including the germline genetic biomarker-based clinical trials they may be eligible for.\n\nFor more information, visit the study website at: prostatecancerpromise.org",

In the real-world that is the VHA, the investigators have successfully estimated g values that accurately predict OS and the use of this metric in other settings should now be explored. In the egalitarian system that is the VHA the treatment of prostate cancer is excellent, uniform across the US and indifferent to race. The choices made are clearly personalized, given not all men received all therapies and that younger Veterans were treated more aggressively.\n\nBut with survivals that rival those in registration trials that enroll optimally fit individuals usually not encumbered by the co-morbidities that afflict many Veterans, the outcomes are testimony to the fact that for this common malady of older Veterans with whom VA physicians have broad experience the care administered is unsurpassed. Importantly this care at least as regards Veterans with mCRPC demonstrates that given equal access to health care, African Americans with prostate cancer fared as well if not better than Caucasians and importantly had better outcomes with abiraterone, an observation needing further exploration as these therapies move up front.",

In medical practices, the implementation of metformin for these off-label indications is variable, often at the level of the provider. Multiple retrospective investigations have also shown a clinical benefit in men with prostate cancer who are incidentally treated with metformin.\n\nThis pragmatic study will test the feasibility of enrolling patients who have glucose intolerance (as defined by HbA1c of 5.7-6.4%) and/or who have increased BMI (BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2) to a randomized pragmatic study of metformin plus lifestyle modification information versus lifestyle modification information only. For purposes of the scope of this project and the study's feasibility, this will be implemented in a group of prostate cancer patients, who may have additional benefits from metformin.",

      "summary": "The purpose of this phase 1 clinical trials is to determine whether niraparib (a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi)) can be safely combined with irinotecan with manageable toxicity and reasonable efficacy. Emerging evidence suggest that PARPi is an effective therapeutic strategy in a wider subset of solid tumors that may have defective homologous recombination (HR) or DNA repair gene mutations. BReast CAncer gene (BRCA), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), and various other DNA repair germline mutations predispose carriers to cancers of the breast, ovaries, pancreas, prostate and melanoma. A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated that PARP inhibitors can work as chemopotentiators. There is significant interest in this combination, and the recommended phase II dose will be used in the upcoming NCI ComboMatch trial.",

This study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the side effects of an investigational drug or an investigational combination with another drug. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is still being studied and research doctors are trying to find out more about it. Although Enzalutamide is already being used to treat men with prostate cancer, combining Enzalutamide with TVB-2640 together in patients with prostate cancer is considered experimental. This research study is being done because additional effective treatments are needed for prostate cancer that has spread and is growing despite hormone suppression. By doing this study, the investigators hope to learn if combining Enzalutamide with TVB-2640 can be done safely. Participation in this research will last about 12 to 24 months after enrollment.",

Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Giving carboplatin before surgery may shrink tumors in patients with high-risk prostate cancer with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effects of shorter chemotherapy (chemo)-immunotherapy without anthracyclines to usual chemo-immunotherapy for the treatment of early-stage triple negative breast cancer. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Docetaxel is in a class of medications called taxanes. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline chemotherapy drug that damages DNA and may kill cancer cells. Pembrolizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Shorter treatment without anthracycline chemotherapy may work the same as the usual anthracycline chemotherapy treatment for early-stage triple negative breast cancer.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests how well vorinostat works in treating patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-low castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic) (mCRPC). Prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body (localized) is typically treated through surgery or radiotherapy, which for many men is curable. Despite definitive local therapy, cancer that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent) disease develops in 27-53% of men. Often this is detected by measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) without visible evidence of metastatic disease. Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu-prostate specific membrane antigen \\[PSMA\\]-617) is a new small molecule PSMA-targeted radioactive therapy that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult patients with PSMA-positive mCRPC who have been treated with androgen receptor inhibitors and taxane-based chemotherapy. Vorinostat is used to treat various types of cancer that does not get better, gets worse, or comes back during or after treatment with other drugs. Vorinostat is a drug which inhibits the enzyme histone deacetylase and may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving vorinostat and 177Lu-PSMA-617 may kill more tumor cells in in patients with PSMA-low mCRPC.",

      "summary": "This phase I/II trial tests the safety and effectiveness of cell therapy (STEAP1 CART) with enzalutamide in treating patients with prostate cancer that continues to grow despite surgical or medical treatments to block androgen production (castration-resistant) and that has spread from where it first started (the prostate) to other places in the body (metastatic). Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men. Localized prostate cancer is often curable and even metastatic disease may respond to treatment for a few years. Despite multiple therapies, including hormone therapy and chemotherapy, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) still remains an incurable disease. Recently, adoptive cellular immunotherapies have been developed to transfer immunogenic cells to the patient to produce an anti-tumor response. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART)-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T-cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack tumor cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's tumor cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Prostate stem cell antigen and prostate specific membrane antigen CAR T cell therapies have been shown to be safe and effective, but objective tumor responses remain rare. STEAP1 is an antigen that promotes cancer growth and spread and is found to be broadly expressed in mCRPC tissues. STEAP1 CART is CAR T cells that have been engineered with a STEAP1 antigen to better target prostate tumor cells. Enzalutamide is in a class of medications called androgen receptor inhibitors. It works by blocking the effects of androgen (a male reproductive hormone) to stop the growth and spread of cancer cells. Giving STEAP1 CART with enzalutamide may kill more tumor cells in patients with mCRPC.",

It also studies the effects of salvage radiation therapy (sXRT) on prostate cancer and to see if radiation to the pelvis helps prevent prostate cancer from spreading elsewhere. SBRT is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position a patient and precisely deliver radiation to tumors in the body (except the brain). The total dose of radiation is divided into smaller doses given over several days. This type of radiation therapy helps spare normal tissue. Androgen can cause the growth of prostate cells. ADT lowers the amount of androgen made by the body. This may help stop the growth of tumor cells that need androgen to grow. Androgen receptor pathway inhibitors work by blocking the effects of androgen to stop the growth and spread of tumor cells. sXRT is a targeted radiation treatment for the prostate, typically given when cancer possibly returns after surgery or radiation. Its goal is to destroy any tumor cells in the area. Giving SBRT alone with watchful waiting may be as effective in treating prostate cancer as giving SBRT together with ARPI and ADT and sXRT may be effective in treating prostate cancer and preventing it from spreading elsewhere.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of adding carboplatin to the standard of care chemotherapy drug cabazitaxel versus cabazitaxel alone in treating prostate cancer that keeps growing even when the amount of testosterone in the body is reduced to very low levels (castrate-resistant) and that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cabazitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Prednisone is often given together with chemotherapy drugs. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs and to help the chemotherapy work. Giving carboplatin with the standard of care chemotherapy drug cabazitaxel may be better at treating metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial evaluates whether genetic testing in prostate cancer is helpful in deciding which study treatment patients are assigned. Patient cancer tissue samples are obtained from a previous surgery or biopsy procedure and tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) abnormalities or mutations in their cancer. Valemetostat tosylate is in a class of medications called EZH1/EZH2 inhibitors. It blocks proteins called EZH1 and EZH2, which may help slow or stop the spread of tumor cells. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Cabazitaxel injection is in a class of medications called microtubule inhibitors. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of tumor cells. Abiraterone acetate blocks tissues from making androgens (male hormones), such as testosterone. This may cause the death of tumor cells that need androgens to grow. It is a type of anti-androgen. Enzalutamide is in a class of medications called androgen receptor inhibitors. It works by blocking the effects of androgen (a male reproductive hormone) to stop the growth and spread of tumor cells. Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan is in a class of medications called radiopharmaceuticals. It works by targeting and delivering radiation directly to tumor cells which damages and kills these cells. Assigning patients to targeted treatment based on genetic testing may help shrink or slow the cancer from growing",

Beyond BRCA1/2, other genes are known to increase the risk of prostate cancer, including ATM, TP53 and HOXB13. The investigators have shown that 5% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer localized to their prostate gland and up to 10-15% of patients with metastatic prostate cancer gland are carriers of an inherited gene mutation.\n\nThe Prostate Tissue BioBank is a prospective study which aims to create a biorepository of prostate tissue samples from prostate biopsies and prostatectomies and matched germline DNA from pathogenic mutation carriers in addition to age-matched control samples. Our primary goal is to investigate prostate cancer development and treatment response in carriers of germline DNA repair mutations, as compared to non-carrier controls.",

      "summary": "This clinical trial compares the impact of a tailored survivorship care plan (SCP) to a standard SCP on the understanding of and access to survivorship care in black or African American patients with prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body (localized) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to a limited number of places in the body (oligometastatic). SCPs summarize treatment history and recommendations for monitoring and maintaining health, and may also include potential long term effects of treatments received. The intention of a SCP is to help patients participate in their own health care. However, many patients have below basic levels of health literacy, meaning, they have a lower ability to obtain, communicate, process and understand basic health information and services to make health decisions. In fact, poor health literacy has been linked with worse quality of life in prostate cancer survivors. A tailored SCP includes the addition of an educational supplement based on lower reading and writing skills (low literacy) and may address health literacy barriers to understanding of treatment options and side effects. A standard SCP uses a template based on the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines for prostate cancer. A tailored SCP with low literacy educational supplements may be more effective compared to a standard SCP in improving understanding and access to survivorship care in black or African American patients with localized or oligometastatic prostate cancer.",
