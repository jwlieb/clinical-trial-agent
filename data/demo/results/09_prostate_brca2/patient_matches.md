- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 85%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), an included condition.
- Patient has an ECOG performance status of 1.
- Patient is 72 years old, which is above the minimum age requirement of 18.
- Patient has a history of disease progression despite prior therapies, including enzalutamide and docetaxel.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, matches the trial's inclusion of prostate cancer. The patient has progressed on standard therapies, aligning with the trial's criteria for previously treated patients. ECOG status and age are acceptable, confirming a high likelihood of eligibility.

### [NCT06659614](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06659614)

**Prostate Tissue Biobank for People at Genetic Risk for Aggressive Disease**

- **Sponsor**: Abramson Cancer Center at Penn Medicine
- **Phase**: N/A
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 85%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Confirmed pathogenic variant: BRCA2 germline mutation
- Age: 72
- ECOG status: 1
- No brain metastases

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type is metastatic prostate cancer, which matches the trial's focus on prostate cancer and genetic predisposition. The patient is confirmed to have a BRCA2 mutation, meeting the biomarker requirement. Furthermore, the patient is not treatment-naive, but the trial eligibility does not exclude previously treated patients, leading to a determination of matching criteria overall.

### [NCT04662580](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04662580)

**A Phase 1, Multicenter, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation, and Dose-Expansion Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-Tumor Activity of ARX517 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors in Subjects With Metastatic Prostate Cancer**

- **Sponsor**: Janssen Research & Development, LLC
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 70%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient is male and 72 years old, which meets age criteria (≥18 years)
- Patient has histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma (prostate cancer)
- Patient has documented evidence of disease progression on prior therapies (enzalutamide, docetaxel, olaparib)
- Patient's ECOG status is 1, which is acceptable
- No brain metastases noted
- Patient has a BRCA2 germline mutation, indicating a DNA repair deficiency, aligning with the interest in combination approaches for such tumors

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has received enzalutamide, which is excluded for combination cohorts

**? Uncertainties:**
- Adequate blood counts not provided in patient profile
- PSMA positivity not explicitly confirmed in patient profile

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial's target as they have metastatic prostate cancer. They also meet the age and ECOG status criteria. However, they have previously received enzalutamide, which is a significant conflict with the eligibility criteria for this trial. While there are uncertainties regarding blood counts and PSMA positivity, the overall likelihood of match reflects that they meet mostly relevant criteria despite the conflict.

### [NCT04706663](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04706663)

**A Multi-Center Natural History Study of Precision-Based Genomics in Prostate Cancer**

- **Sponsor**: National Cancer Institute (NCI)
- **Phase**: N/A
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Histologically confirmed prostate cancer
- Germline BRCA2 mutation
- ECOG status is 1 (acceptable for trials)
- Age is 72 (above 18)

**? Uncertainties:**
- Lack of specific information on the presence of required gene mutations (PIK3, AKT, etc.) in addition to BRCA2
- Unclear if the patient qualifies as an exceptional responder based solely on past therapy outcomes

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial's indication, and he meets the age and ECOG status criteria. However, there are uncertainties related to the required biomarker specifications and whether his past response qualifies him as an exceptional responder.

### [NCT01441089](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01441089)

**Collection of Blood From Therapeutic Trial Participants for Analysis of Genetic Differences in Drug Disposition and Pharmacokinetics of Probe Medications**

- **Sponsor**: National Cancer Institute (NCI)
- **Phase**: N/A
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age >= 3 years old
- ECOG status of 1

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has previously been treated with systemic therapies, while trial information does not specify whether previously treated patients are eligible.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Trial requires participants to be enrolled in an NIH intramural research program which is not confirmed in the patient profile.
- Unclear if the patient’s treatment classifies as 'current treatment' as specified in trial.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type of prostate cancer matches the trial's conditions studied. The patient is also above the minimum age requirement and has a manageable ECOG status. However, the trial does not clarify if it accepts previously treated patients, raising doubts about eligibility. The requirement for NIH intramural program enrollment also introduces uncertainty.
