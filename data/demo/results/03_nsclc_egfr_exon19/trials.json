      "summary": "Rare tumors are understudied, yet have the potential to shed light on vast areas of cancer research. Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors, rare tumors of childhood and young adulthood, have recently been found to be associated with a lung cancer of early childhood called pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB). The cause of these ovarian tumors is unknown. DICER1 mutations are seen in the majority of children with PPB. Research shows DICER1 mutations are also seen in some patients with ovarian tumors. Like PPB, ovarian stromal tumors are highly curable when found in early stage; however, later forms of the disease are aggressive and often fatal. The International Ovarian Stromal Tumor Registry collects clinical and biologic data to understand why these tumors occur and how to treat them. Current work involves the study of the role of DICER1 and miRNA expression in ovarian stromal tumors. Understanding the clinical history, predisposing factors and DICER1 and miRNA expression in these ovarian tumors of childhood will lead to targeted screening and risk stratification for evidence-based treatment and biologically rational therapies. These efforts will improve the lives of children by increasing survival and reducing late effects.\n\nThe specific goals of the International Ovarian and Testicular Stromal Tumor Registry are:\n\n1. to understand risk factors by studying age, pathologic subtype, histopathologic features, tumor invasiveness, degree of differentiation, presence of metastasis\n2. to collect information on personal and family history in order to refine the clinical characteristics of patients and families with and without germline DICER1 mutations and other genetic predisposing factors\n3. to determine whether there is a pattern of gene expression or DNA alterations that correlate with predisposition to ovarian tumors, biologic behavior and clinical outcome\n4. to determine optimal screening regimens\n5. to use clinical data obtained through the Registry to refine treatment algorithms\n6. to establish a collection of annotated biology specimens (tumor tissue and germline DNA) for future research",

Radiation therapy uses high energy gamma rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Astatine-211-labeled BC8-B10 monoclonal antibody is a monoclonal antibody, called anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8-B10, linked to a radioactive/toxic agent called astatine 211. Anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8-B10 is attached to CD45 antigen positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers astatine 211 to kill them. Giving astatine-211 BC8-B10 monoclonal antibody and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant may help stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of bevacizumab and osimertinib combination vs. osimertinib alone for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that has spread outside of the lungs (stage IIIB-IV) and has a change (mutation) in a gene called EGFR. The EGFR protein is involved in cell signaling pathways that control cell division and survival. Sometimes, mutations in the EGFR gene cause EGFR proteins to be made in higher than normal amounts on some types of cancer cells. This causes cancer cells to divide more rapidly. Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking EGFR that is needed for cell growth in this type of cancer. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Giving osimertinib with bevacizumab may control cancer for longer and help patients live longer as compared to osimertinib alone.",

There are very few living adults with this disease. There is also no known treatment for it. Researchers want to see if a new drug can slow down or stop overgrowth in people with Proteus syndrome.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn if miransertib is a safe and effective treatment for Proteus syndrome.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 3 and older with Proteus syndrome.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical checkup. They will answer questions about their medical history and current health. They will have a physical exam with vital signs. They will have an electrocardiogram to measure their heartbeat. They will give blood and urine samples. They will repeat the screening tests during the study.\n\nParticipants will take a miransertib pill once a day. They will bring their empty pill bottles with them to the NIH when they visit. If they can t swallow a pill, researchers will try to find other ways for them to take the drug.\n\nParticipants will have X-rays, ultrasounds, and imaging scans. Photos may be taken of their feet and other parts of the body that have or develop signs of Proteus syndrome.\n\nParticipants will have lung function tests to measure how much and how fast air moves out of their lungs.\n\nParticipants will complete surveys about their levels of pain, physical functioning, and quality of life.\n\nParticipants may have additional tests performed to assess their individual disease. They may have consultations with other specialists.\n\nParticipation lasts about 4 years. Participants will have 20-30 visits at the NIH....",

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a solid tumor, a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the lung. Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is a solid tumor, a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the head and neck. The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events and pharmacokinetics of Azirkitug (ABBV-514) as a monotherapy and in combination with Budigalimab or Bevacizumab,.\n\nBevacizumab is an approved product, while Budigalimab and Azirkitug (ABBV-514) are investigational drugs being developed for the treatment of NSCLC, HNSCC, and other solid tumors. Study doctors put the participants in groups called treatment arms. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) of Azirkitug (ABBV-514) will be explored. Each treatment arm receives a different dose of Azirkitug (ABBV-514) in monotherapy and in combination with Budigalimab or Bevacizumab. Approximately 512 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across approximately 80 sites worldwide.\n\nParticipants will receive Azirkitug (ABBV-514) as a monotherapy or in combination with Budigalimab or Bevacizumab as an Intravenous (IV) Infusion for an estimated treatment period of up to 2 years.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.",

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the deadliest form of lung cancer. The standard first-line treatment is the combination of carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab. While response rates for this regimen are high (roughly 60%), the duration of response is short, typically 4 months. Following progression after the 1st line treatment of SCLC, there is no consensus regarding subsequent therapy. Lurbinectedin is FDA approved and is increasingly preferred in clinical practice. Toxicity was significant, but appeared favorable compared to historic results with topotecan, leading to the adoption of this therapy for second-line SCLC. The toxicity profile was dominated by myelosuppression.\n\nThis study investigates the effect of Trilaciclib on myelosuppression rate in subjects with platinum refractory extensive stage (ES)- SCLC receiving Lurbinectedin as well as the clinical synergy of Trilaciclib and Lurbinectedin combination.",

      "summary": "This phase II Lung-MAP treatment trial test the combination of targeted drugs (capmatinib, osimertinib, and/or ramucirumab) in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) and that has EGFR and MET gene changes. Capmatinib and osimertinib are in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. They work by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells and may help shrink tumors. Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody that may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Giving capmatinib, osimertinib, and/or ramucirumab and targeting abnormal gene changes in tumor cells may be effective in shrinking or stabilizing advanced non-small cell lung cancer.",

      "summary": "Although non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), c-ros oncogene 1(ROS1), and ret proto-oncogene (RET) gene fusions initially respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies, acquired resistance is inevitable. In many of these cases, increased activation of the erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homologue (ERBB) or cMet pathways appears to be a bypass signaling mechanism that allows these cancer cells to circumvent the selective pressure from TKIs. Recent data have suggested that these pathways compensate for each other in situations where one pathway is inhibited, leading to \"kinase switch\" drug resistance. Thus, the expected inhibition of both pathways via treatment with the amivantamab and combination TKI combination may improve overall efficacy by limiting the compensatory pathway activation.",

      "summary": "This clinical trial studies the effect of short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) exercise on immune characteristics and function (phenotype) of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Most newly-diagnosed CLL patients have early-stage disease at the time of diagnosis and do not require treatment. Despite not needing therapy, these patients have significant immune dysfunction. This may lead to an increased risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization and an increased risk of secondary non-blood-based (hematologic) cancers. Increasing CLL patients overall physical fitness levels, through exercise during the observation stage, may provide a realistic approach means to increase survival, decrease treatment-related side effects, and improve immune function. Information learned from this study may help researchers determine whether a particular exercise regimen can be used to strengthen the immune system of indolent NHL and CLL patients, delay time to disease progression, assess the need for treatment, and assess infection rates.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the impact of subcutaneous (SC) nivolumab given in an in-home setting to an in-clinic setting on cancer care and quality of life. Currently, most drug-related cancer care is conducted in clinic type centers or hospitals which may isolate patients from family, friends and familiar surroundings for many hours per day. This separation adds to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families. Traveling to and from medical facilities costs time, money, and effort and can be a disadvantage to patients living in rural areas, those with low incomes or poor access to transport. Studies have shown that cancer patients often feel more comfortable and secure being cared for in their own home environments. SC nivolumab in-home treatment may be safe, tolerable and/or effective when compared to in-clinic treatment and may reduce the burden of cancer and improve the quality of life in cancer patients.",

Wilms Tumor is the most common type of kidney cancer in children, and FHWT is the most common subtype. Previous large clinical trials have established treatment plans that are likely to cure most children with FHWT, however some children still have their cancer come back (called relapse) and not all survive. Previous research has identified features of FHWT that are associated with higher or lower risks of relapse. The term \"risk\" refers to the chance of the cancer coming back after treatment. Using results of tumor histology tests, biology tests, and response to therapy may be able to improve treatment for children with FHWT.",

While doxorubicin is the standard of care therapy for sarcomas not removable by surgery, older or more frail patients may struggle to tolerate side effects of the treatment including immune cell suppression. Previous studies have suggested that similar anti-tumor activity can be obtained using a lower dose, weekly administration schedule of doxorubicin. In this study, the investigators will determine progression-free survival rate at 12 weeks, with secondary endpoints including quality of life and adverse events in this population. Importantly, doxorubicin can also induce immune stimulatory effects when administered at lower doses, based on animal data. Thus, correlative samples including blood and tumor biopsies will also explore the effects of immune cells and foreignness of the tumor prior to and during treatment in study patients.",

The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events and change in disease activity of telisotuzumab adizutecan compared to standard of care (SOC).\n\nTelisotuzumab adizutecan is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of NSCLC. This study will be divided into two stages, in the first stage (phase 2) participants will receive 1 of 2 doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan. In the second stage (phase 3) participants will receive the recommended phase 3 dose (RP3D) of telisotuzumab adizutecan, from the previous stage, or SOC. Approximately 430 adult participants with NSCLC will be enrolled in the study in 200 sites around the world.\n\nIn phase 2, participants will receive 1 of 2 intravenous (IV) doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan. In phase 3, participants will receive the IV RP3D of telisotuzumab adizutecan, or SOC. The study will run for a duration of approximately 69 months.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side effects.",

Successful smoking cessation yields the majority of its health benefits (e.g., avoidance of lung cancer) after years of sustained behavioral change; however, people who smoke cigarettes tend to show elevated rates of delay discounting (i.e., devaluation of delayed outcomes) and a bias for immediate gratification. The overall goal of this project is to develop different versions of an episodic future thinking intervention (i.e., visualization of the future) and test their feasibility and efficacy for smoking cessation in rural and urban populations.",

      "summary": "This research study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a novel immunotherapy, Fast TIL, an Adoptive Cellular Therapeutic (ACT), to fight cancer that has spread to the pleura or pleural mesothelioma. The ACT product is created at AHN West Penn using the participant's pleural infiltrating T-cells (PIT). It is administered through a pleural catheter along with the drug Interleukin-2 (IL-2). Based on previous research it is believed that it may help fight the tumor and relieve symptoms.\n\nAs a participant, their pleural fluid will be collected and the PIT cells will be isolated and expanded in the lab to create the ACT product. Before receiving the ACT product through their pleural catheter, they will undergo outpatient lymphodepleting chemotherapy. LDC is a standard procedure for many approved immunotherapy treatments Following the infusion, they'll receive IL-2 through the catheter for two days to stimulate the expanded PIT cells.\n\nThe active treatment phase lasts about three weeks, with follow-up visits over five years at AHN West Penn Hospital, potentially requiring a hospital stay of up to six days. Blood samples will be taken to monitor their response. As this is a first-in-human study, treatment carries an unknown risk up to and including death from toxicity. However, the risks of similar immunotherapy treatments are well documented.",
