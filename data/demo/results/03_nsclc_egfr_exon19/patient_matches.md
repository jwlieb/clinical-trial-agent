## 🟡 MEDIUM Likelihood (3 trials)

### [NCT05498428](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05498428)

**A Phase 2, Open-Label, Parallel Cohort Study of Subcutaneous Amivantamab in Multiple Regimens in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors Including EGFR-mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer**

- **Sponsor**: Janssen Research & Development, LLC
- **Phase**: Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has histologically confirmed metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
- Patient has an EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation
- Patient has ECOG status of 0

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has received prior systemic therapy (osimertinib) which is a requirement for Cohorts 3 and 3b but not for Cohorts 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7
- Patient shows acquired resistance mutation (C797S) which may impact eligibility depending on specific cohort requirements

**? Uncertainties:**
- Specific cohort eligibility (Patient could qualify for Cohort 3 or 3b but needs confirmation about progression after osimertinib)

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type is appropriate as they have metastatic NSCLC that matches the trial. They also have the required biomarker mutation (EGFR exon 19 deletion) and an ECOG status of 0, but their prior treatment with osimertinib raises concerns about the treatment line eligibility, particularly for Cohorts 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7, while they may qualify for Cohorts 3 and 3b. The presence of acquired resistance mutation complicates the assessment further.

### [NCT02178163](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02178163)

**A Study to Assess the Ability to Initiate Therapy in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients Based on Genomic Analyses of Tumor Specimens.**

- **Sponsor**: Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute
- **Phase**: Not Applicable
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
- ECOG status 0

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has prior systemic therapy (osimertinib) but trial does not specify if previously treated patients are allowed.

**? Uncertainties:**

- Biopsy requirements related to prior treatments and timing are unclear.

**Assessment:**
> The disease type matches as the patient has NSCLC and is in a Stage IV context, which aligns with the trial's focus on advanced NSCLC. However, the patient has a history of prior therapy (osimertinib), and it is unclear if previously treated patients are accepted in this trial, which introduces uncertainty in eligibility. More information on lab tests and biopsy criteria is needed.

- Patient's PD-L1 TPS is 5%, which does not meet any specified biomarker thresholds for eligibility

**? Uncertainties:**
- No details on treatment line or whether prior therapy disqualifies
- No explicit requirements for the specific biomarker or treatment history mentioned in trial details

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type (NSCLC) matches the trial's target indication. However, the patient has prior therapy (osimertinib), creating uncertainty regarding the treatment line eligibility. Additionally, the patient's PD-L1 TPS at 5% does not appear to meet any threshold, further complicating eligibility assessment. The overall assessment reflects these uncertainties.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Measurable disease status** (per RECIST 1.1) - required for most therapeutic trials
