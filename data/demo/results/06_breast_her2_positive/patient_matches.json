Originally diagnosed as Stage IIA in 2021, received neoadjuvant TCHP with pCR. Developed bone-only metastatic recurrence 2 years later. First-line trastuzumab/pertuzumab + docetaxel achieved PR, then progression at 10 months. Second-line T-DM1 ongoing x6 cycles with mixed response - new liver lesions noted. Interested in ADC combinations or novel HER2 agents. Baseline cardiac function LVEF 58%. No CNS disease. Mild neuropathy from prior taxanes."
