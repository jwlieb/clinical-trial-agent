## 🟡 MEDIUM Likelihood (1 trials)

### [NCT06695845](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06695845)

**A Phase 2, Open-label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Zanidatamab for the Treatment of Participants With Previously Treated HER2-expressing Solid Tumors (DiscovHER PAN-206)**

- **Sponsor**: Jazz Pharmaceuticals
- **Phase**: Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has HER2 positive breast cancer, which is included in the trial conditions.
- Patient has an ECOG status of 1.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has had prior systemic therapies including TCHP, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, docetaxel, and T-DM1, which may not align with the requirement of 'previously treated patients' depending on cohort eligibility.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Patient's eligibility for Cohort 2 is unclear since it requires prior therapy with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), which is not mentioned in the profile.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's breast cancer type matches the trial, and their ECOG status is acceptable. However, their extensive prior treatment history presents a conflict related to treatment line eligibility. Additionally, uncertainty exists regarding the specific requirement for trastuzumab deruxtecan in their treatment history.

## 🟠 LOW Likelihood (2 trials)

### [NCT06055881](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06055881)

**Primary Breast Oligoprogressive Sites Treated With Radiotherapy to Obviate the Need to Change Systemic Therapy (BOSS)**

- **Confidence**: 30%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age ≥ 18 years

- Patient has more than 3 extracranial sites of oligoprogressive disease (as indicated by new liver lesions).
- Patient has received multiple prior systemic therapies, which suggests that eligibility based on treatment line may not align.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Details on prior response duration to systemic therapies are not stated clearly in the profile.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type matches the trial, but they have not met the required treatment response timelines nor can it be clearly established given prior therapies. Additionally, the presence of new liver lesions raises further concerns about the oligoprogressive criteria.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **PD-L1 expression status** - required by several trials for cohort assignment
- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
