      "summary": "Background:\n\n* Membranous nephropathy is associated with damage to the walls of the glomeruli, the small blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste products from the blood. This damage causes leakage of blood proteins into the urine and is associated with low blood protein levels, high blood cholesterol values, and swelling of the legs. These problems can decrease or go away without treatment in about 25 percent of patients, but if they persist, some patients may experience impaired (or loss of) kidney function, blood vessel and heart disease, and a risk of forming blood clots in veins.\n* Kidney biopsies that show that antibodies have been deposited along the glomeruli suggest that specialized cells of the immune system, called B and T cells, are causing damage to the kidneys through their increased activity. To suppress the action of B and T cells and to decrease the harmful deposits in the kidneys, drug treatments are required.\n* Patients with membranous nephropathy are often treated with immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine or cytoxan plus steroids that attempt to reduce or suppress the activity of the immune system, decrease antibody production, and reduce antibody deposits in the kidney. However, not everyone responds to these medications and the kidney disease can return in some patients when the drugs are stopped. Also, there are side effects associated with long term usage of these medications. Rituximab, a different immunosuppressant, has also been used for this purpose. Although cyclosporine and Rituximab have been used separately, they have not been tried in combination as a possible treatment for membranous nephropathy.\n\nObjectives:\n\n\\- To determine the safety and effectiveness of combining rituximab and cyclosporine to treat membranous nephropathy.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Individuals 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with membranous nephropathy based on a kidney biopsy done within the preceding 24 months, and who have had excess levels of protein in the urine for at least 6 months based on urine and blood tests.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Potential participants will be screened with an initial clinic evaluation and full medical history.\n* Before the treatment, there will be a run-in period that will last up to 2 months. During this time, participants will be placed on a blood pressure lowering medication and will not take any other immunosuppressant medications.\n* Participants will visit the NIH clinical center for a baseline evaluation, four intravenous infusions of rituximab, and also at 1- to 6-month intervals throughout the study.\n* Active treatment period will involve a 6-month course of cyclosporine and a total of four doses of rituximab. Participants will take cyclosporine tablets twice daily, and have two infusions of rituximab given 2 weeks apart, After 6 months, the cyclosporine dose will slowly be decreased over several weeks and then completely discontinued. Participants will then receive another course (two doses 2 weeks apart) of rituximab, depending on results of blood work.\n* Participants will have frequent blood and urine tests performed to monitor the results of treatment and reduce the chance of side effects.",

        "raw_text": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the following criteria:\n\n1. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study\n2. Male or female, \\>= 18 years of age\n3. Nephrotic range proteinuria that persists for at least 6 months post diagnosis of membranous nephropathy greater than 3.5 grams /24 hours (based on 24-hour urine collection).\n\n   a. If the subject s renal function rapidly declines in less than 6 months could proceed with immunosuppression therapy sooner such as complications of the nephrotic syndrome that are not controlled with supportive therapy or evidence of decline in glomerular filtration rate or proteinuria \\>8 grams/day. Subjects with declining renal function and/or high-grade proteinuria due to MN are considered \"high risk\" subjects and have a higher probability of progression to end stage kidney disease.\n4. Nephrotic range proteinuria (\\>3.5 g/24 hours) that persists despite angiotensin antagonist therapy (ACE inhibitor or ARB) for at least 2 months unless intolerant.\n\n   a. The rationale is that blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAAS) is widely considered to be part of the standard of care treatment for subjects with the nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic range proteinuria will be defined as an estimated average proteinuria \\>3.5 g/24 hours in adults based on at least two 24-hour urine protein excretions obtained prior to initiating therapy. Incomplete urine\n\n   collections (based on inadequate creatinine excretion) will be excluded.\n5. Renal biopsy within the past 24 months must reveal typical changes of membranous nephropathy by light and electron microscopy or a positive anti-PLA2R antibody test in the serum. There has been a change in the management strategies for MN such that a renal biopsy is not absolutely required for diagnosis if patient has positive circulating anti-PLA2R antibody.\n\n   a. Based on published KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guidelines 3.1.1 patients with MN who are positive for anti-PLA2R do not require renal biopsy as long as renal function is normal (eGFR \\>60) and has not had immunosuppression as it has been demonstrated that results of the biopsy have not altered clinical approach and management. If not PLA2R positive, renal biopsy within 24 months is still required.\n6. Blood pressure \\<=140/90 on \\>75% of measurement while on anti-hypertensive treatment for at least 1-2 months.\n7. There is no evidence to suggest secondary forms of membranous nephropathy.\n8. Ability to take oral medication and be willing to adhere to the cyclosporine regimen\n9. For females of reproductive potential: use of highly effective contraception for at least 1 month prior to screening and agreement to use such a method during study participation and for 12 months after the last Rituximab infusion.\n10. For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms or other methods to ensure effective contraception with partner.\n11. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nAn individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:\n\n1. Estimated GFR\\<40 ml/min/1.73 m\\^2 from the preceding 2 months prior to enrollment while on ACEI/ARB therapy.\n2. Immunosuppressive medications or experimental medications of any type during the three-month period prior to initiating Rituximab and cyclosporine.\n3. Prior exposure to cyclosporine or tacrolimus for more than 6 months and/or evidence of intolerance or toxicity associated with cyclosporine treatment of any duration including irreversible azotemia, liver dysfunction or hypertension\n4. Rituximab use within the previous 12 months.\n5. Clinically significant medical conditions (i.e., severe heart failure NYHA class IV, uncontrolled coronary artery disease/unstable angina), which in the opinion of the investigator, could increase the subject s risk of participating in the study or could confound the interpretation of the results of the study.\n6. Positive HIV serology\n7. Positive HCV serology\n8. Active acute or chronic infection requiring antimicrobial therapy or serious viral infection cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, varicella zoster virus (chicken pox or shingles), Parvovirus B19 (can be based on previous medical records within the past 24-months)\n9. Live viral vaccines within one month prior to Rituximab.\n10. Pregnancy or lactation\n11. Cancer diagnosis or cancer recurrence within the preceding 5 years, excluding basal cell carcinoma of the skin. The rationale is that immunosuppression may accelerate cancer progression.\n12. Clinical evidence of cirrhosis or chronic active liver disease sufficiently severe to impair cyclosporine metabolism; this would include a prolonged prothrombin time.\n13. Cytopenia (neutrophils \\<1500/mm\\^3 and/or thrombocytopenia \\<75,000) and/or CD4 T cell count \\<200/mm\\^3). The rationale is that Rituximab therapy may be followed by cytopenia with the granulocyte lineage being at greatest risk. Patients with low CD4 T cell counts are prone to infection which can be exacerbated by Rituximab.\n14. Diabetes mellitus. The rationale is that diabetes may lead to worsening of proteinuria that would not respond to immunosuppression and would confound the results.",

Antiangiogenetic therapy has emerged as new treatment option in solid malignancies. The frequent, metronomic schedule targets both proliferating tumor cells and endothelial cells, and minimizes toxicity. In this study the investigators will evaluate the use of biweekly intravenous bevacizumab in combination with five oral drugs (thalidomide, celecoxib, fenofibrate, and alternating cycles of daily low-dose oral etoposide and cyclophosphamide), augmented with alternating courses of intrathecal etoposide and cytarabine. The aim of the study is to extend therapy options for children with recurrent or progressive medulloblastoma, ependymoma and ATRT, for whom no known curative therapy exists, by prolonging survival while maintaining good quality of life. The primary objective of the MEMMAT trial is to evaluate the activity of this multidrug antiangiogenic approach in these heavily pretreated children and young adults. Additionally, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), as well as feasibility and toxicity will be examined.",

We also hope to learn the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.\n\nIn this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor cells.\n\nInvestigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. Both CAdVEC and HER2-specific autologous CAR T are investigational products. They are not approved by the FDA.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial studies how well the combination of avelumab with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan works in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that is stage IV or is not able to be removed by surgery (unresectable) and has come back (recurrent). Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors like avelumab require activation of the patient's immune system.\n\nThis trial includes a two week induction or lead-in of medications that can stimulate the immune system. It is our hope that this induction will improve the response to immunotherapy with avelumab. One treatment, sacituzumab Govitecan, is a monoclonal antibody called sacituzumab linked to a chemotherapy drug called SN-38. Sacituzumab govitecan is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TROP2) receptors, and delivers SN-38 to kill them. Another treatment, liposomal doxorubicin, is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained in very tiny, fat-like particles. It may have fewer side effects and work better than doxorubicin, and may enhance factors associated with immune response. The third medication is called binimetinib, which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and may help activate the immune system. It is not yet known whether giving avelumab in combination with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan will work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.",

The dose expansion phase (phase Ib) of this trial compares how colorectal and gastroesophageal cancers with HER2 mutation respond to treatment with a combination of ceralasertib and trastuzumab deruxtecan versus trastuzumab deruxtecan alone. Ceralasertib may stop the growth of tumor cells and may kill them by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Ceralasertib and trastuzumab deruxtecan may be safe, tolerable and effective in treating patients with advanced solid tumors expressing the HER2 protein or gene.",

Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies and forms of targeted therapy that attach to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab or pertuzumab attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Hyaluronidase is an endoglycosidase. It helps to keep pertuzumab and trastuzumab in the body longer, so that these medications will have a greater effect. Hyaluronidase also allows trastuzumab and trastuzumab/pertuzumab to be given by injection under the skin and shortens their administration time compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab alone. Paclitaxel is a taxane and in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Giving Herceptin Hylecta or Phesgo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin may shrink the tumor and prevent the cancer from coming back in patients with HER2 positive endometrial cancer.",

This Phase III trial builds on the efficacy and safety data reported in the previous Phase II VIRO-15 trial with promising objective response rate and progression-free survival observed in heavily pre-treated patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. The phase II results also showed that the intra-peritoneal route of delivery was efficient in generating tumor cell killing and immune activation, and led to clinical reversal of platinum-resistance or refractoriness in this difficult-to-treat patient population.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests whether using genetic testing of tumor tissue to select the optimal treatment regimen works in treating patients with clear cell renal cell (kidney) cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic). The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved regimens for advanced kidney cancer fall into two categories. One treatment combination includes two immunotherapy drugs (nivolumab plus ipilimumab), which are delivered by separate intravenous infusions into a vein. The other combination is one immunotherapy drug (nivolumab infusion) plus an oral pill taken by mouth (cabozantinib). Nivolumab and ipilimumab are \"immunotherapies\" which release the brakes of the immune system, thus allowing the patient's own immune system to better kill cancer cells. Cabozantinib is a \"targeted therapy\" specifically designed to block certain biological mechanisms needed for growth of cancer cells. In kidney cancer, cabozantinib blocks a tumor's blood supply. The genetic (DNA) makeup of the tumor may affect how well it responds to therapy. Testing the makeup (genes) of the tumor, may help match a treatment (from one of the above two treatment options) to the specific cancer and increase the chance that the disease will respond to treatment. The purpose of this study is to learn if genetic testing of tumor tissue may help doctors select the optimal treatment regimen to which advanced kidney cancer is more likely to respond.",

      "summary": "The majority of patients (pts) with breast cancer have hormone receptor positive (HR+) disease, and this holds true for pts with advanced breast cancer (ABC). Currently frontline therapy for pts with HR+ ABC is antihormonal therapy with an aromatase inhibitor or selective estrogen receptor degrader plus a CDK4/6i. The proposed trial is a randomized study to further evaluate the potential benefit of switching a frontline regimen at the time that a molecular signal, ctDNA, suggests progression prior to detection of clinical progression using standard methods. The purpose of this study is to determine whether switching treatment earlier in the disease process, based on molecular progression, will increase the amount of time that a patient's metastatic breast cancer is controlled compared to patients with metastatic breast cancer who receive treatment later based on diagnostic imaging results or other methods currently used in medical practice.",

Belantamab mafodotin (BLENREP) was approved in the US in August 2020 under an FDA program called accelerated approval. In November 2022, belantamab mafodotin was removed from the market because a study to further confirm its activity in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma did not deliver a supporting result. However, this confirmatory study demonstrated that some patients may still benefit from treatment with belantamab mafodotin, and that this benefit can be long lasting. Belantamab mafodotin is often given at large academic medical centers every 3 weeks. This study will assess whether it is possible to administer belantamab in the community setting every 6 weeks. It is unknown if administering belantamab every 6 weeks versus every 3 weeks will result in improved safety and/or reduced efficacy.",

Fatigue and arthralgias/myalgias are common symptoms in breast cancer patients taking aromatase inhibitors (AI). Given the long duration of AI treatment for some women (up to 10 years), these symptoms can significantly impact quality of life and premature discontinuation of AIs, a beneficial medication. Reishi mushrooms are among several medicinal mushrooms that have been used for hundreds of years, mainly in Asian countries, to help enhance the immune system, reduce stress, improve sleep, and lessen fatigue. Reishi mushroom extracts have not been studied explicitly for treatment-induced arthralgias/myalgias, but have been shown to improve quality of life, muscular strength, pain, and flexibility. Information from this study may help researchers determine the effect of Reishi mushroom extract on fatigue and arthralgias/myalgias in breast cancer patients receiving an AI.",

Although survival has improved, there are nevertheless diminishing durations of response to each subsequent line of therapy. This highlights the need for further therapeutic innovation. BCMA-targeting CAR-T cells show impressive response rates; however, their median duration of response is disappointing. The investigators propose that CS1(SLAMF7)-targeting CAR-T cells will fill a gap in the MM armamentarium.\n\nCS1 is an attractive target in MM because it is expressed in most patients. Elotuzumab (Empliciti\u00ae), an approved anti-CS1 antibody, has proven the clinical efficacy of this target. CAR-T cells are an ideal modality to target CS1, given that two approved treatments, ide-cel (idecabtagene vicleucel, AbecmaTM) and cilta-cel (ciltacabtagene autoleucel, Carvykti\u2122), have proven the potential for cellular immunotherapy in MM.\n\nThe investigators are testing the safety and preliminary anti-myeloma efficacy of WS-CART-CS1, a CAR-T cell therapy targeting CS1.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests how well ARX788 works in treating patients diagnosed with HER2-low, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. ARX788 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is given by infusion (diluted and injected slowly into veins). Antibodies are proteins which are naturally produced by the body's immune system to help fight infections. ARX788 consists of antibodies that have been attached to a toxin that has the potential to kill cancer cells. ARX788 sticks to a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), which is found on some breast cancer cells. Giving ARX788 may be safe and effective in treating patients with HER2-low locally advanced unresectable metastatic breast cancer.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests how well stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) works in treating patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER +) breast cancer that has spread from where it first started to other places in the body (metastatic) and has limited disease progression (oligoprogression). Currently, the standard of care for breast cancer patients with oligoprogressive disease is to change systemic therapy when progression occurs. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. SBRT is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position a patient and precisely deliver radiation to tumors in the body (except the brain). The total dose of radiation is divided into smaller doses (fractions) given over several days. This type of radiation therapy helps spare normal tissue and has been shown to improve survival. SBRT may kill more tumor cells and allow patients with oligoprogressive ER + metastatic breast cancer to continue taking current systemic treatment.\n\nThis trial also tests how well ER targeted positron emission tomography (PET)/ computed tomography (CT) imaging, using FES, works in identifying progressive disease in patients with ER + metastatic breast cancer. FES, a radiolabeled substance, binds to estrogen receptors and gives off radiation that can be detected by a PET scan. The PET scan, an established imaging technique that utilizes small amounts of radioactivity attached to very minimal amounts of tracer, FES, forms an image that shows where tumor cells with estrogen receptors can be found in the body. CT images use x-rays to provide an exact outline of organs. FES PET/CT may improve identification of progressive disease in patients with ER + metastatic breast cancer.",

TTM is a common mushroom. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is used for enhancing function and removing toxins, as well as for cancer, hepatitis, and infections. There is previous evidence of significant tumor shrinkage occurring in the 2-month window between diagnosis and surgery in women who have taken TTM. Giving TTM may be effective in treating post-menopausal women with HER2-negative, ER-positive breast cancer undergoing surgery.",

Rizatriptan benzoate (MAXALT), is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine1B/1D (5-HT1B/1D) receptor agonist. Rizatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors which leads to activation of these receptors results in cranial vessel constriction, inhibition of neuropeptide release and reduced transmission in trigeminal pain pathways with resultant relieve of the headache.\n\nTeh investigators hypothesize that the administration of Rimegepant ODT would provide better analgesic efficacy than Rizatriptan ODT with respect to analgesic efficacy at 60 min and 120 minutes in ED patients with acute headache.\n\nThis is a prospective, randomized, double-blind superiority trial evaluating and comparing analgesic efficacy and safety of Rimegepant ODT 75 mg to Rizatriptan ODT 10 mg in adult patients presenting to the Emergency Department of Maimonides Medical Center with acute migraine headache.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of low dose tamoxifen to usual hormonal therapy, including aromatase inhibitors, in treating post-menopausal women with hormone positive, HER2 negative early stage breast cancer. Tamoxifen is in a class of medications known as antiestrogens. It blocks the activity of estrogen (a female hormone) in the breast. This may stop the growth of some breast tumors that need estrogen to grow. Aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, prevent the formation of estradiol, a female hormone, by interfering with an aromatase enzyme. Aromatase inhibitors are used as a type of hormone therapy to treat postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Giving low dose tamoxifen may be more effective compared to usual hormone therapy in treating post-menopausal women with hormone-positive, HER2 negative early stage breast cancer.",
