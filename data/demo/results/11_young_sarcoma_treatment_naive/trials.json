      "summary": "Background:\n\nApproximately 150 cases of cancer per one million per year are considered rare cancers. While all tumors originate from genetic changes, a small percentage of these tumors are familial. Researchers want to study these changes in biological samples from people with rare tumors in order to learn more about how these tumors develop. The information obtained from this study may lead to improved screening, preventive guidelines, and treatments.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo better understand rare cancers and hereditary cancer syndromes.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople who have a rare tumor, a family history of a rare tumor, a hereditary cancer syndrome, or a mutation that leads to rare tumors.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with questions about their medical history and/or that of their family members. They will give a saliva sample.\n\nParticipants who have a tumor will have their medical records and tests reviewed. They will answer questions about their wellbeing and needs. They may provide a tumor tissue sample.\n\nParticipants may also have:\n\n* Physical exam\n* Clinical photography\n* Blood, urine, saliva, and stool samples taken\n* Consultation with specialists\n* A scan that produces a picture of the body. Either one that uses a small amount of radiation, or one that uses a magnetic field.\n* Genetic testing/genetic counseling.\n\nParticipants will be contacted once a year. They will answer updated questions about their medical and family history.\n\nParticipants will be asked to contact the study team if there are changes in their tumors.\n\nParticipants may be invited to join focus groups for people with the same diagnosis of rare tumors.\n\nParticipants may be invited to participate in other NIH protocols.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nRARE TUMOR LIST:\n\n1.

      "summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the basis for three widely held fundamental tenets about surgical intervention for thumb basal joint arthritis;\n\n1. Trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and metacarpal stabilization is associated with superior functional outcomes and strength,\n2. Preservation of the arthroplasty space correlates with functional outcomes, pain relief, and restoration of strength after basal joint arthroplasty, and\n3. Mitigation of metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) hyperextension optimizes postoperative strength after basal joint arthroplasty, regardless of surgical technique.\n\nIt is hypothesized that thumb basal joint arthroplasty with metacarpal stabilization, by either ligament reconstruction (I) or suture suspension (II), provides greater improvement in grip and pinch strength, and better hand function, than might be achieved following provision of pain relief alone by simple trapeziectomy (III). Preservation of the arthroplasty space will correlate positively, and MCPJ hyperextension will correlate negatively, with improved thumb function and lateral pinch strength.\n\nPrimary Aims (within 3 procedure cohorts):\n\n1. Compare pre-operative pinch and grip strength as well as patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for pain in patients before and after lidocaine injection of the trapeziometacarpal joint, prior to thumb basal joint arthroplasty;\n2. Compare post-operative pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and function at 3 and 6 months after thumb basal joint arthroplasty with pre-operative values before and after lidocaine injection;\n3. Correlate preservation of dynamic arthroplasty space as measured on a stress radiograph with postoperative improvement in pinch and grip strength, and PROs for pain and function;\n4. Correlate dynamic MCP joint position and laxity with change in strength and patient-reported pain and function to define optimal MCPJ position.\n\nSecondary Aims (between 3 procedure cohorts):\n\n1. Compare change in pre- and post-operative pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and function between patients having basal joint arthroplasty with and without specific metacarpal stabilization;\n2. Compare preservation of the dynamic arthroplasty space and improvement in strength and patient-reported pain and function between arthroplasty groups; and\n3. Compare changes in pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and function with dynamic MCPJ position between arthroplasty groups.\n4.

      "summary": "The purpose of this study is to learn whether it is safe to give HER2-CAR T cells in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug (pembrolizumab or nivolumab), to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with sarcoma.\n\nAnother goal of this study is to study the bacteria found in the stool of patients with sarcoma who are being treated with HER2 CAR T cells and immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs to see if the types of bacteria influence how well the treatment works.\n\nThe investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. They now want to see if they can put a new gene in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells. The new gene that the investigators will put in makes an antibody specific for HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) that binds to sarcoma cells. In addition, it contains CD28, which stimulated T cells and make them last longer. After this new gene is put into the T cell, the T cell becomes known as a chimeric antigen receptor T cell or CAR T cell.\n\nIn another clinical study using these CAR T cells targeting HER2 as well as other studies using CAR T cells, investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the effect the T cells can have. Giving chemotherapy before a T cell infusion is called lymphodepletion since the chemotherapy is specifically chosen to decrease the number of lymphocytes in the body. Decreasing the number of the patient's lymphocytes first should allow the infused T cells to expand in the body, and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively.\n\nThe chemotherapy used for lymphodepletion is a combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.\n\nAfter the patient receives the lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR T cells during treatment on the study, they will receive an antibody drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab or nivolumab. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are drugs that remove the brakes on the immune system to allow it to act against cancer.",

This study will assess a combination of a pharmacologic intervention and a psychosocial one. The pharmacologic intervention is a one-time dose of 100mg ketamine delivered intramuscularly (IM) while the patient is in the ED. The psychosocial intervention under study is a brief, patient-centered therapy which takes, on average, 30 minutes to administer. Both interventions will be administered only once. The main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\n* Determine if 100mg of IM ketamine and Crisis Response Plan in combination results in greater short-term reductions in suicidal ideation in adult patients who report acutely elevated suicide risk during an ED visit.\n* Examine potential weight-based dose response differences in the reductions in suicidal ideation to determine if future treatment protocols with IM ketamine may benefit from weight-based dosing.",

      "summary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of combination therapy with liposomal doxorubicin and peposertib in treating patients with sarcoma that has spread from where it first started, to other places in the body (metastatic), or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and for which no known cure is available (advanced). Doxorubicin is in a class of medications called anthracyclines. Doxorubicin damages the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It also blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair. Liposomal doxorubicin is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained inside very tiny, fat-like particles. Liposomal doxorubicin may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of the drug. Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also enhance the activity of chemo- and radiotherapy. There is some pre-clinical evidence in animal models that combining peposertib with liposomal doxorubicin can shrink or stabilize certain types of cancer for longer than either drug alone, but it is not known if this will happen in people. Combination therapy with liposomal doxorubicin and peposertib may be effective in treating patients with advanced sarcoma.",

These participants were no longer benefiting from standard medications and had no good treatment options. In that study, some participants who were treated with linvoseltamab had improvement of their myeloma (shrinkage of their tumors), including some participants who had complete responses (that is, the treatment got rid of all evidence of myeloma in their bodies).\n\nThis study is focused on participants who have multiple myeloma that has returned or needs to be treated again after one to four prior treatments and have standard cancer treatment options available to them. The aim of this study is to see how safe and effective linvoseltamab is compared to a combination of three cancer drugs: elotuzumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone, (called EPd) in participants who have returned after having received prior treatment that included lenalidomide, a proteosome inhibitor, and (for participants in some countries) a cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) antibody. Half of the participants in this study will get linvoseltamab, and the other half will get EPd.\n\nThis study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* How long participants benefit from receiving linvoseltamab compared with EPd\n* How many participants treated with linvoseltamab or EPd have improvement of their multiple myeloma and by how much\n* What side effects happen from taking linvoseltamab compared to EPd\n* How long participants live while receiving treatment or after treatment with linvoseltamab compared to EPd\n* If there is any improvement in pain after treatment with linvoseltamab compared to EPd",

      "summary": "Postural instability is a common symptom of vestibular dysfunction that impacts a person's day-to-day activities. Vestibular rehabilitation is effective in decreasing dizziness, visual symptoms and improving postural control through several mechanisms including sensory reweighting. As part of the sensory reweighting mechanisms, vestibular activation training with headshake activities influence vestibular reflexes. However, combining challenging vestibular and postural tasks to facilitate more effective rehabilitation outcomes is under-utilized. The novel concurrent headshake and weight shift training (Concurrent HS-WST) is purported to train the vestibular system to directly impact the postural control system simultaneously and engage sensory reweighting to improve balance. Young healthy participants will perform the training by donning a virtual reality headset with an overhead harness on and a spotter present to prevent any falls. The investigators propose that this training strategy would show improved outcomes over traditional training methods by improving vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) gains, eye movement variability, sensory reweighting and promoting postural balance. The findings of this study may guide clinicians to develop rehabilitation methods for vestibular postural control in neurological populations with vestibular and/or sensorimotor control impairment.",

The purpose of this study is to assess molecular changes in adult participants with moderate to severe HS or with moderate to severe AD.\n\nLutikizumab (ABT-981) is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of HS and AD. This study will consist of 2 sub-studies: Sub-Study 1 moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa and Sub-Study 2 moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Approximate 60 participants will be enrolled in the study at approximately 2 sites in the US.\n\nIn Sub-Study 1 HS participants will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of lutikizumab for up to week 15 with a 70-day follow-up period. In Sub-Study 2 AD, participants will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of lutikizumab for up to week 14 with a 70-day follow-up period. The study duration for Sub-Studies 1 and 2 is expected to last up to 30 weeks.\n\nParticipants in Sub-Study 1 (HS) who complete Week 16 and showed a therapeutic benefit to lutikizumab, as confirmed by the investigator, will have the option to enter an open-label long-term extension (LTE) to continue to receive lutikizumab for up to an additional 140 weeks, followed by a 70-day follow-up period.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests, and biomarker collections.",

      "summary": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can cure patients with blood cancer and other underlying diseases. \u03b1\u03b2-T cell and B cell depletion has been introduced to decrease GVHD and PTLD and has demonstrated effectiveness for hematologic malignancies and non-malignant diseases additionally increasing the donor pool as to allow for haploidentical transplant to safely occur.\n\nWhile solid tumors can be highly chemotherapy sensitive, many remain resistant and require multimodalities of treatment. Immunotherapy has been developed to harness the immune system in fighting solid tumors, though not all have targeted effects. Some solid tumors are treated with autologous transplants; however, they do not always demonstrate an improved event free survival or overall survival. There has been evidence of the use of allogeneic stem cell transplants to provide a graft versus tumor effect, though studies remain limited.\n\nBy utilizing \u03b1\u03b2-T cell and B cell depletion for stem cell transplants and combining with zoledronic acid, the immune system may potentially be harnessed and enhanced to provide an improved graft versus tumor effect in relapsed/refractory solid tumors and promote an improved event-free survival and overall survival.\n\nThis study will investigate the safety of treatment with a stem cell graft depleted of \u03b1\u03b2-T cell and CD19+ B cells in combination with zoledronic acid in pediatric and young adult patients with select solid tumors, as well as whether this treatment improves survival rates in these patients.",

People living with these conditions might find it hard to stay alert and pay attention when they are at school, working, driving, or performing other daily activities.\n\nWhile all conditions result in feeling sleepy, there are some differences in other common symptoms:\n\n* NT1: People with NT1 often feel very tired during the day and experience cataplexy. Cataplexy is a sudden loss of muscle strength, which can cause someone to collapse or lose control of their muscles for a short time. This is often triggered by strong emotions, such as laughter or surprise. They may also have trouble sleeping well at night.\n* NT2: People with NT2 feel sleepy during the day, just like NT1, but they do not have cataplexy.\n* IH: People with IH feel tired during the day, even after sleeping a lot at night. They may sleep for long periods, take long naps, and find it hard to wake up.\n\nOrexin is a protein in the brain that helps coordinate a system that plays an important role in helping people to stay awake during the daytime. ORX750 is designed to mimic the action of orexin. The purpose of this study is to see how safe and tolerable ORX750 is in NT1, NT2, and IH, and learn about what the drug does to the body. Another goal of the study is to see if ORX750 can help people with NT1, NT2, and IH feel less sleepy and make other symptoms better.",

People can join the study if they have these conditions and do not have a history of heart failure. The purpose of this study is to find out if a medicine called vicadrostat, when taken with empagliflozin, helps reduce cardiovascular risk in people with these conditions. The study will compare this combination to a placebo version of vicadrostat with empagliflozin.\n\nParticipants are put into 2 groups randomly, which means by chance. One group takes vicadrostat and empagliflozin tablets, and the other group takes placebo tablets with empagliflozin. Placebo tablets look like vicadrostat tablets but do not contain any medicine.\n\nParticipants take a tablet once per day for 2 and a half years and up to 4 years and 3 months. All participants also continue their medication for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease. Participants have an equal chance of receiving the study medicine or placebo.\n\nParticipants are in the study for up to 4 years and 3 months. During this time, they visit the study site regularly. During these visits, doctors collect information about participants' health and take blood samples. The doctors document when participants experience cardiovascular events. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.",

Synovial sarcoma is a rare, slow-growing cancer that affects the soft tissues, like muscles or ligaments near the joints. Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma is a rare type of soft tissue sarcoma cancer that originates from fat cells usually in the arms and legs. N-803 is a type of immunotherapy-a treatment that helps patients' own immune system fight cancer, and it is made up of a natural protein called interleukin-15 (IL-15) that is important for growing and activating immune cells. Studies have shown that patients can progress after initially responding to TCR-T, so this trial will use N-803 to stimulate rare persisting cells (cells that survive treatment and cause treatment failure and disease relapse) to make them work better at attacking the cancer. Adoptive cell therapy is a type of therapy that uses a patient's own immune cells to fight cancer. T-cell receptor therapy is a type of ACT that can recognize better recognize and bind to protein in cancer cells. Giving N-803 may be safe and tolerable in patients with SS or MRCL.",

      "summary": "This study examines a novel way to prevent suicide among Veterans with serious mental illness (SMI). It will assess the efficacy of PREVAIL-VA, a 3-month intervention of 12, one-on-one sessions between a Peer Specialist (PS) and a Veteran that involve semi-structured conversations focused on hope, belongingness, support, and safety. PSs are Veterans with SMI trained to use their own experience and recovery to help other Veterans with SMI. PSs have improved mental health outcomes in other research, but this study would be the first to test their efficacy for suicide prevention in VHA. The project will compare outcomes of Veterans at risk for suicide receiving usual care, to PREVAIL-VA. This work is responsive to national calls for Veterans with SMI to receive support that is evidence-based, improves recovery (not just symptoms), and is tailored to individual needs. If successful, PREVAIL-VA could be adopted by the 1400 Peer Specialists employed in VA, greatly increasing the delivery of evidence-based services to Veterans at risk for suicide.",
