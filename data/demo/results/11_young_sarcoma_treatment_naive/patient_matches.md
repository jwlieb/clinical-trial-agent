## 🟢 HIGH Likelihood (2 trials)

### [NCT05910307](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05910307)

**Synovial Sarcoma Registry and Biospecimen Repository**

- **Sponsor**: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
- **Phase**: N/A
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 85%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient is a female aged 28
- Reported diagnosis of synovial sarcoma
- ECOG status is 0
- No brain metastases
- No prior systemic therapy (treatment-naive)

**? Uncertainties:**
- Pending comprehensive molecular profiling and any specific biomarker requirements not defined in trial criteria

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type of synovial sarcoma matches the trial's focus. The patient is treatment-naive, fulfilling the eligibility requirements. The ECOG status is acceptable, and there are no brain metastases. The only uncertainty remains regarding the comprehensive molecular profiling, but overall, the patient meets the significant criteria.

### [NCT05227326](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05227326)

**First in Human Phase 1 Study of AOH1996 in Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors**

- **Sponsor**: City of Hope Medical Center
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 85%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age: 28 years old
- ECOG status: 0
- Cancer type: synovial sarcoma matches trial conditions studied
- Biomarker: SS18-SSX fusion present
- No brain metastases
- No prior systemic therapy - seeking first-line options

**? Uncertainties:**
- Laboratory criteria (ANC, platelets, total serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, creatinine clearance) information is pending

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type, treatment line, and ECOG status align with the trial's eligibility criteria. The patient is treatment-naive, which is suitable for the first in human phase 1 study, and meets most other criteria except for pending lab results.

## 🟡 MEDIUM Likelihood (1 trials)

### [NCT06748872](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06748872)

**EPITOME-1015-I: a Phase I Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Efficacy of a Third Generation TCR-T Therapy, MDG1015, in Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma, Gastroesophageal (Junction) Adenocarcinoma, Myxoid (Round Cell) Liposarcoma And/or Synovial Sarcoma Subjects with Advanced Disease Expressing NY-ESO-1 And/or LAGE-1a**

- **Sponsor**: Medigene AG
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Not yet recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age: 28
- ECOG status: 0
- Cancer type: synovial sarcoma
- No prior systemic therapy - seeking first-line clinical trial options

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Tumor must have tested positive for NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1a mRNA expression - patient profile does not confirm this biomarker requirement.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Patient's HLA genotype is not provided, which impacts eligibility.
- Comprehensive molecular profiling is pending, leading to uncertainty about required biomarkers.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type (synovial sarcoma) matches the trial's focus. However, the eligibility depends on specific biomarker testing that has not been completed, leading to uncertainty in their eligibility. Additional verification on biomarker status is required for a definitive assessment.

## 🟠 LOW Likelihood (2 trials)

### [NCT06946225](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06946225)

**A First-in-human, Open-label Trial to Evaluate the Combination of ACTengine® IMA203 With mRNA-4203 in Previously Treated, Unresectable or Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma or Synovial Sarcoma Patients (ACTengine® IMA203-102)**

- **Sponsor**: Immatics US, Inc.
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 29%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age: 28
- Sex: female
- ECOG status: 0
- Cancer type: synovial sarcoma

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has not received any prior systemic therapy but trial requires patients to have received at least one line of treatment for synovial sarcoma.
- Trial specifies that participants must have HLA-A*02:01 positivity, which is not confirmed in patient profile.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Adequate organ function not provided
- No information on HLA typing
- Comprehensive molecular profiling results are pending

**Assessment:**
> The patient's disease type (synovial sarcoma) matches the trial's criteria; however, the patient does not meet the treatment line requirement as she is treatment-naive, whereas the trial requires at least one prior treatment for synovial sarcoma. Additionally, there are uncertainties regarding HLA status and organ function which further complicate eligibility.

### [NCT05711615](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05711615)

**A Phase 1 Study of Peposertib (M3814) and Low-Dose Liposomal Doxorubicin in Patients With Metastatic Leiomyosarcoma and Other Soft Tissue Sarcomas**

- **Sponsor**: National Cancer Institute (NCI)
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 20%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age: 28
- Sex: female
- Cancer type: synovial sarcoma
- ECOG status: 0
- Brain metastases: none

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Trial requires patients to have been treated with at least 1 prior line of therapy, while the patient has no prior systemic therapy.

**Assessment:**
> The patient has synovial sarcoma, which is a match for the trial's conditions studied. However, the trial requires that patients have had at least one prior line of therapy, while the patient is treatment-naive. This critical mismatch leads to exclusion.
