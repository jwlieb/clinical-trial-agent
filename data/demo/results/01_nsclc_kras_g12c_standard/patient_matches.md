### [NCT05074810](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05074810)

**A Phase 1/2 Study of Avutometinib (VS-6766) in Combination With Sotorasib With or Without Defactinib in Patients With KRAS G12C Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)**

- **Sponsor**: Verastem, Inc.
- **Phase**: Phase 1/Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age: 65
- Sex: male
- Cancer type: NSCLC
- Biomarkers: KRAS G12C
- ECOG status: 1
- Prior therapies: carboplatin/pemetrexed, pembrolizumab (received appropriate treatment with at least one prior systemic regimen)
- No brain metastases
- Adequate organ function (Creatinine 1.1, LFTs normal, ANC 3.2, platelets 245k)

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has received prior therapies and the trial includes patients who have not been previously treated with a KRAS inhibitor to be included in Part B.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type of NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation matches the trial's subject. However, due to prior treatments with a G12C inhibitor (pembrolizumab), there is uncertainty regarding the treatment line eligibility as the trial specifies exposure to G12C inhibitors for inclusion criteria. Thus, the patient likely qualifies but requires further verification regarding the treatment line.

### [NCT05609578](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05609578)

**A Phase 2 Trial of Combination Therapies With Adagrasib in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With KRAS G12C Mutation**

- **Sponsor**: Mirati Therapeutics Inc.
- **Phase**: Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has a diagnosis of advanced NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation.
- Patient has PD-L1 TPS of 40%.
- Patient presents no brain metastases.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has previously received systemic therapy (carboplatin/pemetrexed, pembrolizumab) which may impact eligibility.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Organ function lab results are clear, but history of treatments used and their timelines for the specific cohort may need more clarity.

**Assessment:**
> The disease type is a match, but the patient has received prior systemic therapies, making it unclear if they are eligible for the trial which seems focused on treatment-naive or first-line patients. Additionally, the PD-L1 TPS is below 50%, qualifying for a specific cohort, but prior treatment history complicates eligibility further.

### [NCT06545331](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06545331)

**A Dose-Escalation and Expansion Study of XB010 as a Single Agent and Combination Therapy in Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors**

- **Sponsor**: Exelixis
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Age: 65
- ECOG status: 1
- Cancer type: NSCLC
- Biomarkers: KRAS G12C

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Prior therapies: The patient has received prior systemic therapy (carboplatin/pemetrexed, pembrolizumab) which may not align with trial objectives aimed at treatment-naive patients.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Specific criteria for biomarker qualification regarding acceptable levels of PD-L1 expression are not provided.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type (NSCLC) matches the trial conditions, and the ECOG status and age are acceptable. However, the patient has received prior systemic therapies, potentially conflicting with the treatment line criteria if the trial is aimed at treatment-naive patients. This uncertainty affects the overall confidence level.

## 🟠 LOW Likelihood (1 trials)

### [NCT06130254](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06130254)

**Phase Ib Trial of the KRAS G12C Inhibitor Adagrasib (MRTX849) in Combination With the PARP Inhibitor Olaparib in Patients With KRAS G12C Mutated Advanced Solid Tumors, With a Focus on Gynecological, Breast, Pancreatic and KEAP1 Mutated Non-small Cell Lung Cancers**

- **Sponsor**: M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 20%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation.
- Patient has progressive disease after prior therapies.
- ECOG status 1.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Trial requires KEAP1 co-mutation for NSCLC eligibility, which the patient does not have.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Laboratory values within the screening period: unspecified hemoglobin levels.

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type of NSCLC aligns with the trial. However, the trial requires both KRAS G12C and KEAP1 co-mutations for NSCLC eligibility, which the patient does not possess, leading to exclusion.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Measurable disease status** (per RECIST 1.1) - required for most therapeutic trials
- **Life expectancy estimate** - many trials require ≥3 months
