      "summary": "This study will investigate the genetic cause of Birt Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome and the relationship of this disorder to kidney cancer. BHD is a rare inherited condition characterized by papules, or bumps-benign tumors involving hair follicles-on the head and neck. People with BHD are at increased risk of developing kidney cancer. Scientists have identified the chromosome (strand of genetic material in the cell nucleus) that contains the BHD gene and the region of the gene on the chromosome. This study will try to learn more about:\n\n* The characteristics and type of kidney tumors associated with BHD\n* The risk of kidney cancer in people with BHD\n* Whether more than one gene causes BHD\n* The genetic mutations (changes) responsible for BHD\n\nPatients with known or suspected Birt Hogg-Dube syndrome, and their family members, may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a family history and review of medical records, including pathology reports for tumors, and films of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\n\nParticipants may undergo various tests and procedures, including the following:\n\n* Physical examination\n* Review of personal and family history with a cancer doctor, cancer nurses, kidney surgeon, and genetic counselor\n* Chest and other x-rays\n* Ultrasound (imaging study using sound waves)\n* MRI (imaging study using radiowaves and a magnetic field)\n* CT scans of the chest and abdomen (imaging studies using radiation)\n* Blood tests for blood chemistries and genetic testing\n* Skin evaluation, including a skin biopsy (surgical removal of a small skin tissue sample for microscopic evaluation)\n* Cheek swab or mouthwash to collect cells for genetic analysis\n* Lung function studies\n* Medical photography of skin lesions\n\nThese tests will be done on an outpatient basis in either one day or over 3 to 4 days. When the studies are complete, participants will receive counseling about the findings and recommendations. Patients with kidney lesions may be asked to return periodically, such as every 3 to 36 months, based on their individual condition, to document the rate of progression of the lesions.",

      "summary": "This collaborative screening protocol, developed by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) and supported by the Thoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG), is designed to determine the feasibility of comprehensive molecular profiling to detect actionable oncogenic drivers in patients with suspected early stage lung cancers scheduled to undergo biopsies to establish the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\nThe primary purpose of this testing is to determine the presence of 12 oncogenic drivers (mutations in EGFR, BRAFV600E , MET exon 14, KRAS G12C and HER2, rearrangements in ALK, RET, NTRK, EGFR exon 20 insertion and ROS1, and amplification of MET and HER2) that can serve as targets making patients eligible for upcoming targeted neoadjuvant therapy trials. The ultimate goal is to use this information from the screening process to select the optimal neoadjuvant therapy and wherever possible enroll patients onto separate neoadjuvant therapy trials with genomically matched treatments or other appropriate trials if no actionable driver mutation is detected.\n\nThoracic Surgery Oncology Group (TSOG) is a network of surgeons within North American Thoracic Surgery Academic Centers aligned with the goal of enhancing patient care through administration of multi-site trials focused on recent advances in lung cancer. TSOG has aligned with the LCMC4 sites to enroll the LCRF-LEADER screening trial. TSOG's involvement will be essential in trial enrollment and ultimate interpretation of the multimodal clinical and translational data collected as part of this study. We estimate we will detect an actionable oncogenic driver in 33% of cases. The remaining 66% of patients will represent a cohort identified by their care teams as candidates for other potential neoadjuvant therapies which may include checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab or other novel agents.\n\nThe targeted therapy treatment trials will be conducted independently of the LCRF-LEADER screening trial, evaluating for efficacy. If none of the 10 oncogenic drivers are detected, the patient will be offered participation in any clinical trial of neoadjuvant therapy available at their treating institution or standard of care therapy. For patients not enrolled on a targeted treatment trial, circulating tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA) will be collected at 3 time points: before neoadjuvant treatment, after neoadjuvant treatment but before surgery, and after surgery. This initiative will be correlated with various clinical outcomes. Prespecified clinical data will be collected for correlation with these circulating biomarkers.",

Eligible subjects must have a tumor lesion(s) which is accessible for injection.\n\nThe dose escalation phase (Part 1A - advanced solid tumors) has completed and is closed to enrollment. This phase evaluated multiple doses of MEM-288 dosed via intratumoral injection once every 3 weeks to assess safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and to determine the MTD.\n\nThe dose expansion phase has multiple parts for advanced NSCLC. Part 1B has completed after evaluation of MEM-288 dosed via intratumoral injection in combination with standard of care nivolumab dosed via intravenous injection.\n\nIn a separate dose expansion arm (Part 1C) that is open for enrollment, patients with advanced NSCLC will be randomized to receive either an initial priming dose of MEM-288 injected into an accessible lesion (s) alone (Day 1) followed by MEM-288 in combination with standard of care docetaxel every 3 weeks up to 6 doses or MEM-288 injected into an accessible lesion(s) in combination with standard of care docetaxel therapy Day 1 and every 3 weeks up to 6 doses.\n\nThe study rationale is that the oncolytic effect of MEM-288 combined with the presence of CD40L and type 1 IFN in injected tumors will provide a strong signal for DC-mediated T cell activation leading to generation of systemic anti-tumor T cell responses with broad specificity akin to what is observed in the abscopal effect.",

      "summary": "Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women worldwide and the second most common cancer in terms of new cases. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the deadliest form of lung cancer. The standard first-line treatment is the combination of carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab. While response rates for this regimen are high (roughly 60%), the duration of response is short, typically 4 months. Following progression after the 1st line treatment of SCLC, there is no consensus regarding subsequent therapy. Lurbinectedin is FDA approved and is increasingly preferred in clinical practice. Toxicity was significant, but appeared favorable compared to historic results with topotecan, leading to the adoption of this therapy for second-line SCLC. The toxicity profile was dominated by myelosuppression.\n\nThis study investigates the effect of Trilaciclib on myelosuppression rate in subjects with platinum refractory extensive stage (ES)- SCLC receiving Lurbinectedin as well as the clinical synergy of Trilaciclib and Lurbinectedin combination.",

Sotorasib is in a class of medications called KRAS inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells. Panitumumab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells. Giving combination panitumumab and sotorasib may kill more tumor cells in patients with advanced solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutation.",

      "summary": "Although non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), c-ros oncogene 1(ROS1), and ret proto-oncogene (RET) gene fusions initially respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies, acquired resistance is inevitable. In many of these cases, increased activation of the erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homologue (ERBB) or cMet pathways appears to be a bypass signaling mechanism that allows these cancer cells to circumvent the selective pressure from TKIs. Recent data have suggested that these pathways compensate for each other in situations where one pathway is inhibited, leading to \"kinase switch\" drug resistance. Thus, the expected inhibition of both pathways via treatment with the amivantamab and combination TKI combination may improve overall efficacy by limiting the compensatory pathway activation.",

Most newly-diagnosed CLL patients have early-stage disease at the time of diagnosis and do not require treatment. Despite not needing therapy, these patients have significant immune dysfunction. This may lead to an increased risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization and an increased risk of secondary non-blood-based (hematologic) cancers. Increasing CLL patients overall physical fitness levels, through exercise during the observation stage, may provide a realistic approach means to increase survival, decrease treatment-related side effects, and improve immune function. Information learned from this study may help researchers determine whether a particular exercise regimen can be used to strengthen the immune system of indolent NHL and CLL patients, delay time to disease progression, assess the need for treatment, and assess infection rates.",

Carfilzomib is a drug that binds to and inhibits the activity of the protein complex that is responsible for degrading other damaged or unneeded proteins. The inhibition of this protein by carfilzomib can then cause tumor growth inhibition and cell death. Sotorasib is a drug that binds to and inhibits the activity of the KRAS G12C mutant. This may inhibit growth in KRAS G12C-expressing tumor cells. Combining carfilzomib and sotorasib may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the impact of subcutaneous (SC) nivolumab given in an in-home setting to an in-clinic setting on cancer care and quality of life. Currently, most drug-related cancer care is conducted in clinic type centers or hospitals which may isolate patients from family, friends and familiar surroundings for many hours per day. This separation adds to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families. Traveling to and from medical facilities costs time, money, and effort and can be a disadvantage to patients living in rural areas, those with low incomes or poor access to transport. Studies have shown that cancer patients often feel more comfortable and secure being cared for in their own home environments. SC nivolumab in-home treatment may be safe, tolerable and/or effective when compared to in-clinic treatment and may reduce the burden of cancer and improve the quality of life in cancer patients.",

Pancreas is a long, flat gland that lies in the abdomen behind the stomach. Pancreas creates enzymes that help with digestion. It also makes hormones that can help control your blood sugar levels.\n\nAll participants in this study will take the study medication (PF-07934040) as pill by mouth twice a day repeating for 21-day or 28-day cycles.\n\nDepending on which part of the study participants are enrolled into they will receive the study medication (PF-07934040 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer medications). These anti-cancer medications will be given in the study clinic by intravenous (IV) that is directly injected into the veins at various times (depending on the treatment) during the 21-day or 28-day cycle.\n\nParticipants can continue to take the study medication (PF-07934040) and the combination anti-cancer therapy until their cancer is no longer responding.\n\nThe study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help see if the study medicines are safe and effective.\n\nParticipants will be involved in this study for up to 4 years. During this time, they will come into the clinic between 1 to 4 times in each 21-day or 28-day cycle. After they have stopped taking the study medication (at about at 2 years) they will be followed for another two years to see how they are doing.",

      "summary": "Genes contain genetic code which tell the body which proteins to make. Many types of cancer are caused by changes, or mutations, in a gene called KRAS. Researchers are looking for ways to stop the actions of abnormal proteins made from the mutated KRAS gene.\n\nASP5834 is being studied in people with solid tumors who have certain KRAS gene mutations. Some people with solid tumors of the colon or rectum (colorectal cancer), will be given ASP5834 with panitumumab. Panitumumab is a treatment for colorectal cancer. In this study, the researchers will learn how ASP5834 is processed by and acts upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose of ASP5834 and check for any potential medical problems from the treatment.\n\nThe main aims of this study are to check the safety of ASP5834 given by itself or given with panitumumab, and how well it is tolerated; and to find a suitable dose of ASP5834 given by itself or given with panitumumab.\n\nPeople in this study will be adults with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumors with certain KRAS gene mutations. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The key reasons people cannot take part are if they have specific uncontrollable cancers such as symptomatic or untreated cancers in nervous system, or have a specific heart condition, or infections.\n\nIn this study, ASP5834 is being given to humans for the first time. This is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that they will receive ASP5834 by itself or ASP5834 with panitumumab.\n\nThis study will be in 2 parts:\n\nPart 1 is called Dose Escalation. Different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of either: ASP5834 by itself or ASP5834 with panitumumab. Only people who have colorectal cancer will receive ASP5834 with panitumumab. People with any type of solid tumor will receive ASP5834 by itself. For each dose, all medical problems will be recorded. A medical expert panel will check the results and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP5834. The panel will do this until the planned maximum number of people are treated or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.\n\nPart 2 is called Dose Expansion. Other different small groups of people will receive ASP5834 or ASP5834 with panitumumab. They will receive the most suitable doses worked out from Part 1.\n\nIn both parts of the study, the study treatments ASP5834 and panitumumab will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each study treatment cycle is either 21 days or 28 days long. People will continue study treatment until: they have medical problems from the study treatment they can't tolerate; their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; or they ask to stop study treatment.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic on certain days during their study treatment, with extra visits during the first 2 cycles of study treatment. The study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP5834. Also, people in the study will have a health check. On some visits they will also have scans to check for any changes in their cancer. Tumor samples will be taken at certain visits during study treatment with the option of a tumor sample being taken if people's cancer gets worse or the cancer comes back.\n\nPeople will visit the clinic shortly after stopping treatment for a health check. After this, people will have health checks every couple of months to check the condition of their cancer. The number of visits and checks done will depend on the health of each person and whether they completed their study treatment or not. It is expected that people will be in this study for about 1 year.",
