**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type is high-grade serous ovarian cancer, which fits the trial's focus on high-grade serous and similar types. However, the trial explicitly assesses platinum-resistant/refractory disease, while the patient is currently described as having platinum-sensitive disease, leading to a likely exclusion based on the criteria for disease status.

## Information That Would Improve Matches

The following patient data was not provided but would help refine eligibility assessment:

- **Organ function labs** (hematology, liver, renal) - required by all interventional trials
- **Measurable disease status** (per RECIST 1.1) - required for most therapeutic trials
- **Cardiac status/QTc interval** - relevant for trials with cardiotoxicity risk
