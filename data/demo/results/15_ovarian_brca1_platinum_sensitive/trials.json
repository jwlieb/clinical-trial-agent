It may also bring on early menopause. The researchers will check blood levels of hormones that the ovaries produce. The hormones that researchers will check are anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The researchers will do this before, during, and after cancer treatment. The researchers will also ask you to fill out questionnaires about your menstrual cycle (your periods) and information about your health and pregnancies. This may help us learn which women will be more likely to have early menopause.",

Premenopausal women age 21-45 with stage 0-3 breast cancer. 2. No prior ovarian surgery or ovarian disease. 3. No prior chemotherapy. 4. Regular menstrual periods (21-35 days), no PCOS. 5. No hormonal contraception within the prior 4 weeks. 6. Mutation testing decision based on NCCN Guidelines V1.2021: according to these Guidelines, both centers test all pre-menopausal women with breast cancer for BRCA and non-BRCA mutations which are the subject of this proposal.\n\n7\\. Receiving an anthracycline (typically doxorubicin/Adriamycin) and Cy (AC)-based chemotherapy protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nFor Cohort of Premenopausal Women with Early Stage Breast Cancer\n\n* Prior therapy for breast cancer or any other cancer, such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or immunotherapy.\n* Ovarian resection, unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or radiation to pelvic region.\n* Plans for risk-reducing bilateral oophorectomy within one year of completion of chemotherapy.\n* Prior known infertility; infertility is defined as one year of inability to conceive despite unprotected intercourse and/or the need to use medication (e.g clomiphene) or assisted reproductive technology (e.g. intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization) to attempt pregnancy.\n* Family history of a first-degree relative with non-surgical menopause \\< age 40\n* Current pregnancy.\n\nSubject Exclusion Criteria:\n\nFor Unaffected High Risk Premenopausal Women with BRCA mutation\n\n1. Participant has therapy for breast cancer or any other cancer, such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or immunotherapy.\n2. Participant has ovarian resection, unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy, radiation to pelvic region.\n3. Participant has Plans for risk-reducing bilateral oophorectomy within one year of completion of chemotherapy.\n4.

Subjects who did not undergo mutation testing, as well as those who tested positive for more than one family (BRCA1, BRCA2, non-BRCA) of ATM-Pathway gene mutations, will be excluded.\n\n2\\. Women aged \\>42 years will be excluded as they carry a very high probability of chemotherapy-induced OI49. It is important to select an age range where immediate OI is less likely to occur because if most women become menopausal post-chemotherapy, the comparison of ovarian reserve decline will not be feasible. 3. In our prior grant period, we showed that the AC-based and CMF regimens similarly compromise ovarian reserve (Fig. 1)9 Currently, the AC-based chemotherapy is utilized in \\>90% breast ca cases, and CMF protocol is rarely administered9. For this reason and to enhance uniformity, rare non-AC-based protocols will be excluded. 4. A previous study showed that smoking and BRCA mutations may have additive negative effects on the age of menopause27, consequently, we will exclude current smokers (smoked 100 cigarettes lifetime and currently smokes, per CDC). Based on our past studies6,9, the smoking incidence is low in our study population (\\<20%) and should not significantly limit accrual.\n\n5\\. BMI: In our recent publication9 (Fig. 1), the mean BMI was 24.22 \u00b10.4 (median 23.2; range 17-42); hence the extreme BMI values are rare in our population. Nevertheless, those with BMI of \\<18.5 and \\>40 will be excluded.",

      "summary": "Rare tumors are understudied, yet have the potential to shed light on vast areas of cancer research. Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors, rare tumors of childhood and young adulthood, have recently been found to be associated with a lung cancer of early childhood called pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB). The cause of these ovarian tumors is unknown. DICER1 mutations are seen in the majority of children with PPB. Research shows DICER1 mutations are also seen in some patients with ovarian tumors. Like PPB, ovarian stromal tumors are highly curable when found in early stage; however, later forms of the disease are aggressive and often fatal. The International Ovarian Stromal Tumor Registry collects clinical and biologic data to understand why these tumors occur and how to treat them. Current work involves the study of the role of DICER1 and miRNA expression in ovarian stromal tumors. Understanding the clinical history, predisposing factors and DICER1 and miRNA expression in these ovarian tumors of childhood will lead to targeted screening and risk stratification for evidence-based treatment and biologically rational therapies. These efforts will improve the lives of children by increasing survival and reducing late effects.\n\nThe specific goals of the International Ovarian and Testicular Stromal Tumor Registry are:\n\n1. to understand risk factors by studying age, pathologic subtype, histopathologic features, tumor invasiveness, degree of differentiation, presence of metastasis\n2. to collect information on personal and family history in order to refine the clinical characteristics of patients and families with and without germline DICER1 mutations and other genetic predisposing factors\n3. to determine whether there is a pattern of gene expression or DNA alterations that correlate with predisposition to ovarian tumors, biologic behavior and clinical outcome\n4. to determine optimal screening regimens\n5. to use clinical data obtained through the Registry to refine treatment algorithms\n6. to establish a collection of annotated biology specimens (tumor tissue and germline DNA) for future research",

      "summary": "The purpose of this study is to establish a registry of patients with pancreatic diseases. Patients included in the registry may include those with: pancreatic cancer, precancerous lesions of the pancreas, inflammatory lesions of the pancreas, cystic lesions of the pancreas, and patients at high-risk of pancreatic cancer such as those with a family history of pancreatic cancer or with a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. However, little is known about the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases in individuals with the above conditions. Knowledge of how family history, environmental exposures, and inflammatory lesion of the pancreas contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases is essential.\n\nYou may qualify to take part in this research study because you have inflammation in the pancreas, a pancreatic cyst, pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas, pancreatic cancer, a family history of pancreatic cancer, or a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer.\n\nWe will also be collecting a blood sample from all participants for DNA isolation. Sometimes we are born with genes or DNA that give us an increased or decreased chance of developing an illness later in life. Genetic material will be isolated from your blood for further study. You may also choose to provide additional blood samples for serum and plasma extraction. Serum and plasma are components of the blood which can be used to measure indicators of disease in the blood, called biomarkers,for pancreatic diseases. Clinical data and biological specimens contained in this study may be used for a wide variety of future related studies to the cause, diagnosis, outcome and treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\nFunds for conducting this research are provided by Mount Sinai.",

      "summary": "This study is related to a previous study from the same group which started in 2014 (NTC02288676, McGill REB A08-M79-13B, MUHC REB 2020-5945) to develop a clinically implementable screening test -DovEEgene: developing and validating a novel molecular test for the early diagnosis of cancer of the endometrium, tubes and ovaries. This study is designed to identify endometrial, tubal and ovarian cancer very early based on identifying cancer-specific mutations (cancer DNA) in a pap sample taken from inside the uterus. The results are particularly encouraging given that control group is challenging with high background mutational burden from benign tumours, endometriosis, germ-line mutations etc.\n\nTo date, all the intrauterine samples were obtained using the commercially available TAO brush\u2122 which is designed to take an endometrial sample. However, when patient tolerability was assessed using a numerical pain scale (NPS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain), patients rated the sampling using the TAO brush\u2122 at 3.5 versus 0 for a cervical pap sample. These results were not surprising as the TAO brush\u2122 was designed for dislodging strips of endometrial tissue to use for histopathologic examination. With respect to the investigators objective, which is to collect cancer cells that have exfoliated to the uterus, a sampler that collects these exfoliated cells with as little disturbance as possible to the underlying endometrium is preferred. In this sub-study, the investigators aim to evaluate a new endometrial sampling tool, the DOvEEgene Fleur, which is believe to be superior to the current TAO brush\u2122 in terms of cancer detection, ease of use and patient tolerability. The sampler has been designed using materials/components found in the TAO brush\u2122 and other approved medical devices.",

      "summary": "This phase I trial identifies the side effects and best dose of DS-8201a and olaparib in treating patients with HER2-expressing cancers that have spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery or ovarian cancer that remains despite treatment with a platinum treatment (platinum resistant). Olaparib is a drug that blocks an enzyme involved in many cell functions, including the repair of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. Blocking this enzyme may help keep tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. DS-8201a is an antibody-drug conjugate. This agent has two components: an antibody component and a chemotherapy component. The antibody component is attached to the chemotherapy molecules. Upon administration of DS-8201a, the antibody targets and binds to tumor cells that have abundant HER2 (human-epidermal growth factor receptor 2), which is a protein on the surface of some tumor cells. The chemotherapy then enters the cells and blocks DNA replication in the tumor cells with abundant HER2, causing them to die. Giving DS-8201a and olaparib may shrink or stabilize the cancer.",

Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods outlined for women of child-bearing potential if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method\n* Male subjects must not freeze or donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the study period, and at least 4 months after the final study drug administration.

The samples of the wash and the blood will be taken before surgery. After surgery, doctors will determine whether the participant had ovarian cancer or a benign disease of the ovaries. The tests of the washings and the blood will be examined to see how much the participants with ovarian cancer can be separated from the participants with a benign ovarian disease by the tests. Small amounts from the washing and the blood samples will be sent to four sites for analysis.\n\nStatistical analyses of these data will compare tumor DNA found in the washing of the uterus with proteins in the blood to detect cases of ovarian cancer. The primary goal is to find tests that are mostly positive for cases of ovarian cancer and mostly negative for patients with benign disease. It is hoped that if the tests work for participants with symptoms of the disease that these tests will also work when testing women who have no symptoms. A new study would be needed to see if the tests worked in this situation. If the tests work, this could lead to increasing the number of cases detected in early stage disease and decreasing the number of cases detected in late stage disease. If this change in late stage is large, it will likely reduce deaths due to ovarian cancer.",

Using comprehensive genomic profiling and proteomics, the investigators seek to identify the underlying genomic drivers of premalignant or malignant conditions in participants across different stages of disease development and cancer types.\n\nComprehensive molecular profiling will consist of somatic tumor testing (tissue and/or blood) using whole exome sequencing, whole transcriptome sequencing, proteomics, and selected instances of whole genome sequencing. In addition, the investigators seek to perform broad hereditary cancer testing in affected participant populations. Hereditary testing has implications in screening, prognosis, and therapeutics for affected participants, as well as broad implications for genetic counseling and cascade testing.\n\nIn order to maximize the value of genomic information, participants consented to this protocol will have their electronic health records (both retrospectively and prospectively) abstracted, curated, annotated and linked to genomic information obtained though the testing performed. Given the long-term value of this data, participants will also be asked to voluntarily consent to have their samples stored in a biobank and have their de-identified information used for future research.\n\nInformation collected across this participant population will aid in advancing the investigators' knowledge of cancer biology, to discover and validate biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes, and shared in collaborative projects in order to promote the study of cancer.",

Ovarian cancer is the fifth cause of cancer-related mortality in females in Canada. OS can prevent the most common and lethal type of ovarian cancer, high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). OS during gynecologic surgery (hysterectomy or instead of tubal ligation) is safe and effective. However, rates of hysterectomies and tubal sterilization are decreasing. This research team aims to extend the prevention of ovarian cancer by expanding to offer OS during other surgeries in the pelvis where fallopian tubes are accessible, beginning with colorectal surgery. This study will examine: 1) the feasibility of OS at the time of colorectal surgery; 2) the safety of OS at the time of colorectal surgery; 3) the cost-effectiveness of OS at the time of colorectal surgery.\n\nThe hypothesis is that OS will be well accepted by individuals with fallopian tubes undergoing colorectal surgery, and that the vast majority (around 90 percent) of attempts to remove both fallopian tubes will be successful. It is expected that there will be 10-20 minutes additional operating room time for completing OS and that there will be no increased risk of complications when OS is included in a colorectal surgery. The researchers also hypothesize that OS at the time of colorectal surgery will be cost-effective because of the reduced number of ovarian cancer cases and associated treatment costs.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests whether ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) in combination with talazoparib works to shrink tumors in patients with solid tumors that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with treatment and that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Another aim of this study is to find out if, and how, patients' genes influence their response to this specific drug combination. For this part of the study, investigators will run tests using samples of patients' tumor tissue and blood that will be collected during the study. ZEN-3694 is an inhibitor of a family of proteins called the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET). It may prevent the growth of tumor cells that overproduce BET protein. Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Genes are pieces of the DNA code that individuals inherit from their parents. Some genes work to protect against cancer by correcting damage that can occur in the DNA when cells divide. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two examples of these types of genes, and they are called tumor-suppressor genes. For example, if a person has a mutation in a BRCA1/2 gene they have a greatly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer because their cells may no longer be able to completely repair damaged DNA. It is the accumulation of DNA damage which causes a cell to change into a cancerous cell. Other genes are also involved in this process, and these are called DNA damage repair genes. The KRAS mutation is a change in a protein in normal cells. Normally KRAS serves as an information hub for signals in the cell that lead to cell growth, but when there is a mutation in KRAS it signals too much and cells grow without being told to, which causes cancer. Combination therapy with ZEN-3694 and talazoparib may be effective at slowing or stopping tumor growth in patients with advanced cancer.",

Emerging evidence suggest that PARPi is an effective therapeutic strategy in a wider subset of solid tumors that may have defective homologous recombination (HR) or DNA repair gene mutations. BReast CAncer gene (BRCA), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), and various other DNA repair germline mutations predispose carriers to cancers of the breast, ovaries, pancreas, prostate and melanoma. A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated that PARP inhibitors can work as chemopotentiators. There is significant interest in this combination, and the recommended phase II dose will be used in the upcoming NCI ComboMatch trial.",

Additionally, the effects of niraparib on the developing fetus are unknown. Therefore:\n\n    a. Females of childbearing potential and their male partners are advised to practice a highly effective method of contraception during treatment with niraparib and/or irinotecan and for 180 days following the last dose for females and 90 days following the last dose for males. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless one of the following applies:\n\n    i. Is considered to be permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.\n\n    ii. Is postmenopausal, defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level consistently in the postmenopausal range (30 milli-international units per millilitre (mIU/mL) or higher) may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy; however, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to confirm a postmenopausal state.\n\n    b.

Must agree to use a male condom (and should also be advised of the benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak).\n\n    c. Highly effective contraception is considered to be a method with a \\< 1% per year failure rate. Recommendations for highly effective contraception while taking niraparib include:\n\n    i. Ongoing use of injectable or implantable progesterone.\n\n    ii. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.\n\n    iii. Bilateral tubal occlusion.\n\n    iv. Complete (as opposed to periodic) abstinence\n\n    . v. Male sterilization, with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of absence of sperm in ejaculate.\n13.

For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.\n15. Individuals with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For individuals with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study at clinician's discretion and not otherwise stated below.\n2. Prior allergic reaction to PARP inhibitor or irinotecan or their excipients. Prior PARP inhibitor or irinotecan (or topoisomerase 1 inhibitors) use is allowed.\n3.

      "summary": "This phase I/II trial tests the safety, side effects, best dose, and effectiveness of multi-epitope folate receptor alpha-loaded dendritic cell vaccine (FRalphaDC) with pembrolizumab in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (collectively known as ovarian cancer) that that has come back (after a period of improvement) (recurrent). Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the United States. While the majority of patients achieve a remission from ovarian cancer with the combination of aggressive cytoreductive surgery and cytotoxic chemotherapy, over 80% of patients develop recurrence within 3 years of completion of treatment. Additional treatments are needed for recurrence, but the standard treatment modalities are non-curative in nature due to the development of drug resistance. As such, there is a great unmet need for treatment strategies that utilize new mechanisms to which drug resistance does not develop. FRalphaDC is a dendritic cell vaccine that is made from the white blood cells collected from a procedure call apheresis. The white blood cells are treated to make dendritic cells, which will then be incubated with peptides, which are pieces of a protein known as \"folate receptor alpha\" (FRalpha), a protein that is found in high levels on ovarian cancer cells. Dendritic cell vaccines work by boosting the immune system (a system in the body that protect against infection) to recognize and destroy the tumor cells by targeting the FRalpha protein. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving FRalphaDC vaccine with pembrolizumab may be a safe and effective treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer.",

For this reason and because BETi agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception treatment with M1774 and ZEN003694 and for at least 6 months following the last dose. Women should be advised not to breastfeed while taking M1774 and ZEN003694 and for 1 month after cessation of treatment.\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS) directed therapy shows no evidence of progression, are off steroids, and are stable for at least 1 month.\n* The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry and, for patients treated in the United States (U.S.), authorization permitting release of personal health information.\n* PART II only: Participants must have known mutational status (wild-type or pathogenic or likely pathogenic alteration) for ARID1A by Next-Generation Sequencing.

For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n* Resolution of all toxicities of prior therapy or surgical procedures to baseline or grade 1 (except for hypothyroidism requiring medication, which must have resolved to Grade =\\< 2), alopecia, and other toxicities considered clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive therapy as determined by the investigator).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients who have received prior ATR, ATM, CHK, BET, EZH2, and/or PI3K inhibitors.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ZEN003694 or M1774 used in study.\n* Patients taking proton pump inhibitors given decreased solubility of M1774 with increased pH. Proton pump inhibitors must be discontinued 7 days prior to initiating the trial.\n* Patients with corrected QT (QTc) over 450msec that does not correct with correction of electrolyte abnormalities or family history of long QT syndrome.\n* Patients with severe, active co-morbidity defined as follows:\n\n  * No active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.\n  * Known hereditary diseases characterized by genetic defects of DNA repair mechanisms, including ataxia telangiectasia, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, Werner syndrome, Bloom Syndrome, Fanconi anemia, xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy.\n* Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because ZEN003694 has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects and M1774 is genotoxic in in vivo nonclinical studies. Patients who discontinue breastfeeding are eligible for enrollment and may not resume breastfeeding until 1 month off treatment.\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694. Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided. If alternative is not available, the use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is permitted with careful monitoring and approval by study team. At the discretion of the provider, additional monitoring (labs, toxicity checks) may be implemented for use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Substrates of CYP1A2 with narrow therapeutic window also must be avoided white taking ZEN003694. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are Factor Xa inhibitors are discouraged given concerns for thrombocytopenia (i.e., rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban otamixaban, letaxaban, eribaxaban) and Factor IIa inhibitors (i.e., dabigatran). Low molecular weight heparin is allowed. If patients are not willing to switch to low molecular heparin, they must obtain approval by study team.\n* Serious gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months, refractory nausea and vomiting, uncontrolled diarrhea, known malabsorption, significant small bowel resection or gastric bypass surgery, use of feeding tubes, presence of drainage gastrostomy tube, other chronic gastrointestinal disease, and/or other situations that may preclude absorption of oral medications M1774 and/or ZEN003694.\n* M1774 restrictions:\n\n  * Patients who cannot discontinue drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP1A2.\n  * Patients who cannot discontinue drugs that use hMATE1 or hMATE2-K substrates.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of olaparib for one year versus two years, with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of BRCA 1/2 mutated or homologous recombination deficient stage III or IV ovarian cancer. Olaparib is a polyadenosine 5'-diphosphoribose polymerase (PARP) enzyme inhibitor and may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Giving olaparib for one year with or without bevacizumab may be effective in treating patients with BRCA 1/2 mutated or homologous recombination deficient stage III or IV ovarian cancer, when compared to two years of olaparib.",

Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions) as \u226520 mm with conventional techniques or as \u226510 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be \u226515 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan or MRI (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). See Section 12 for the evaluation of measurable disease.\n\n  * Patients who have received radiation must have evidence of measurable disease outside of the radiation field or have documented progression after radiation at the time of enrollment.\n* Patients must have received at least two prior cytotoxic regimens or have platinum-resistant (defined as having progressed within 6 months of last platinum therapy) or platinum-refractory (having progressed during primary platinum therapy) disease.\n\n  * Participants can have received no more than 3 prior lines of cytotoxic therapy (any agent that targets the genetic and/or mitotic apparatus of dividing cells, resulting in dose-limiting toxicity to the bone marrow).\n  * Unlimited prior hormonal therapy, targeted therapy (including immunotherapy) or antiangiogenic therapy will be permitted.\n* Patients must have completed prior therapy as detailed below:\n\n  * Prior Therapy Time from last prior therapy to study treatment start date Chemotherapy (except nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) \u2265 28 days; Nitrosoureas or mitomycin C \u2265 42 days; Small molecule inhibitors \u2265 28 days; Monoclonal antibodies \u2265 28 days; Immunotherapy \u2265 28 days; Radiotherapy (RT) \u2265 28 days from last local site RT \u2265 28 days from stereotactic radiosurgery; \u2265 12 weeks from craniospinal \u226550% radiation of pelvis or total body irradiation Radiation related side effects must have resolved prior to study enrollment Endocrine therapy \u2265 7 days\n* Ability to take oral medications and not have gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of senaparib or TMZ as judged by the treating physician.\n* Patients assigned female at birth, age \u226518 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of senaparib and TMZ in patients \\<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \u22642 (Karnofsky \u226560%, see Appendix A).\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * Absolute Neutrophil Count \u22651,000/microliter (mcL);\n  * Differential Differential with no clinically significant morphologic abnormalities on complete blood count (CBC) testing.\n  * Manual differential is encouraged, if clinically indicated, and in cases where an automated differential is abnormal.\n  * Hemoglobin \u22659 g/dL;\n  * Platelets \u2265100,000/mcL;\n  * aspartate transferase (AST) (SGOT) or Alanine Transaminase (ALT) (SGPT) \u22643 \u00d7 institutional ULN;\n  * Total Bilirubin \u22641.5 \u00d7 institutional ULN; Direct bilirubin \u2264 ULN for subjects with total bilirubin \\> 1.5 x ULN (patients with isolated indirect bilirubin elevations and a history of Gilbert's Syndrome are eligible)\n  * Creatinine -OR- Glomerular Filtration Rate \u2264 institutional upper limit normal (ULN) -OR- \u226550 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional ULN\n* Because of the potential DNA damaging effects in a developing human fetus with the study treatment, participants of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation including for one month after last dose of senaparib or temozolomide. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Theoretically, CYP3A induction with senaparib use may result in the loss of efficacy in hormonal contraceptives, thus a barrier method of contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives due to the potential drug-drug interaction with senaparib. Note: All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing).\n* For patients with known history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated and the suppressive therapy must not be an excluded concurrent medication.\n* Patients with a known history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, the patients are eligible if the patient has an undetectable HCV viral load and the HCV therapy is not an excluded concurrent medication.\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging \u2265 12 weeks after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression.\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial, with permission of the protocol chair.\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior treatment with a poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor or temozolomide.\n* Patients who are currently receiving or have previously received any other investigational agents within 3 weeks prior to entering the study.\n* Patients who have not recovered (CTCAE v5 grade \u22641) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier, unless those events are deemed to have returned to baseline, are irreversible, or are unlikely to develop into a life-threatening condition at the permission of the Protocol Chair (e.g., alopecia).\n* Patients who have any of the following:\n\n  * A prior history of myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).\n  * Abnormalities known to be associated with MDS (e.g. del 5q, chr 7 abn) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (e.g. JAK2 V617F) observed in cytogenetic testing and DNA sequencing.\n  * A prior history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).\n* Patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of bowel obstruction.\n* Severe, active comorbidity per the treating investigator's clinical discretion.\n* Pregnant or lactating patients.\n* Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are ineligible because the treatments involved in this protocol may be immunosuppressive, increasing the risk of lethal infections in this patient population.\n* Patients with known, untreated brain metastases, as progressive neurologic dysfunction may develop that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to senaparib or temozolomide.\n* Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers should not be used within 3 days of Day 1 dosing until the end of study. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers should be used with caution.\n\nBecause the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/ clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n  * ongoing or active infection, including latent tuberculosis infection,\n  * clinically significant GI disease (such as active Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis),\n  * recent or significant cardiovascular disease (defined as any major CV event within the previous 6 months including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, Pulmonary Embolism (PE), or New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure),\n  * history of liver function abnormality requiring investigation, drug induced liver injury, chronic liver disease, excessive alcohol consumption or chronic alcohol-induced disease,\n  * psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, or\n  * any other severe acute or chronic medical condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects of senaparib and temozolomide. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on study. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the effect of folate receptor alpha dendritic cells (FR\u03b1DCs) to placebo in treating patients with stage III or IV ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. FR\u03b1DCs, a dendritic cell vaccine, is made from a person's white blood cells. The white blood cells are treated in the laboratory to make dendritic cells (a type of immune cell) mixed with folate receptor alpha (FRalpha), a protein found in high levels on ovarian tumor cells. FR\u03b1DCs work by boosting the immune system to recognize and destroy the tumor cells by targeting the FRalpha protein on the tumor cell. Placebo is an inactive substance that looks the same as, and is given the same way as, the active drug or treatment being tested. The effects of the active drug are compared to the effects of the placebo. Giving FR\u03b1DCs may work better in preventing or delaying recurrence compared to placebo in patients with stage III or IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.",

About 3000 people in the United States die from this disease each year. People with inherited mutations in the BAP1 gene \\[called BAP1 Cancer Syndrome (BCS)\\] are more likely to develop mesothelioma and other cancers such as melanomas and renal cell carcinomas without asbestos exposure. Almost all people with BCS develop multiple cancers, of which mesothelioma is the most commonly observed.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a study drug (APG-115) in participants with BAP1 Cancer Syndrome (BCS) and early-stage mesothelioma.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 years and older with germline BAP1 mutations and early-stage mesothelioma that does not yet need standard treatment are eligible for protocol enrollment. Participants will be required to also enroll in NIH protocols 20-C-0106 and 06-C-0014 which allow for pre- and post-treatment biopsies and bloodwork to be obtained for additional research studies.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. Their medical records will be reviewed. They will have imaging scans and tests of their heart and lung functions. A procedure using a flexible tube with a camera and light will be inserted into the participant s chest and abdomen through a small cut to look at the tumors and to collect a tissue sample (biopsy).\n\nAPG-115 capsules are taken by mouth. Participants will take the drug at home every other day for the first 13 days of the 21-day treatment cycles.\n\nOn the first day of each cycle, researchers will call or email participants to check on their health.\n\nParticipants will have blood tests 2 times a week during the first 2 cycles; after that, the blood tests will be weekly. These blood tests can be done at a local medical facility or at the NIH Clinical Center.\n\nParticipants may continue treatment for up to 16 cycles.\n\nImaging scans, biopsy, and other tests will be repeated after 8 and 16 cycles.",
