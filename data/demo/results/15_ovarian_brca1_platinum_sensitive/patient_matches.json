Initial diagnosis Stage IIIC, underwent optimal debulking followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel x6 + niraparib maintenance. First recurrence at 18 months (platinum-sensitive), re-challenged with carboplatin/gemcitabine with PR, continued niraparib. Second recurrence now at 14 months - again platinum-sensitive interval. CA-125 rising (85 -> 340). Considering platinum rechallenge vs clinical trial. No significant residual neuropathy. Interested in novel PARP combinations or antibody-drug conjugates. Excellent performance status."
