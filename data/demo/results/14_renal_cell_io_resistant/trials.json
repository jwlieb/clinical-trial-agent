Bone is a common site of metastasis in advanced cancer, and bone metastases often result in debilitating cancer-related pain. The current standard of care to treat painful bone metastases is radiation therapy alone. However, many patients do not get adequate pain relief from radiation therapy alone. Another type of therapy that may be used to provide pain relief from bone metastases is cryoablation. Cryoablation is a procedure in which special needles are inserted into the tumor site. These needles grow ice balls at their tips to freeze and kill cancer cells. The goal of this trial is to compare how well cryoablation in combination with radiation therapy works to radiation therapy alone when given to cancer patients to provide pain relief from bone metastases.",

Radiation therapy uses high energy photons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses of radiation over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, ipilimumab, avelumab, and pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Axitinib, cabozantinib, and lenvatinib are in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. They work by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Giving SABR in combination with standard of care immunotherapy may help shrink or stabilize the cancer in patients with renal cell cancer.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests whether using genetic testing of tumor tissue to select the optimal treatment regimen works in treating patients with clear cell renal cell (kidney) cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic). The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved regimens for advanced kidney cancer fall into two categories. One treatment combination includes two immunotherapy drugs (nivolumab plus ipilimumab), which are delivered by separate intravenous infusions into a vein. The other combination is one immunotherapy drug (nivolumab infusion) plus an oral pill taken by mouth (cabozantinib). Nivolumab and ipilimumab are \"immunotherapies\" which release the brakes of the immune system, thus allowing the patient's own immune system to better kill cancer cells. Cabozantinib is a \"targeted therapy\" specifically designed to block certain biological mechanisms needed for growth of cancer cells. In kidney cancer, cabozantinib blocks a tumor's blood supply. The genetic (DNA) makeup of the tumor may affect how well it responds to therapy. Testing the makeup (genes) of the tumor, may help match a treatment (from one of the above two treatment options) to the specific cancer and increase the chance that the disease will respond to treatment. The purpose of this study is to learn if genetic testing of tumor tissue may help doctors select the optimal treatment regimen to which advanced kidney cancer is more likely to respond.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial tests the safety of positron emission tomography (PET) guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and how well it works to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that has up to 5 sites of progression (oligoprogression) compared to standard SBRT. SBRT uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. A PET scan is an imaging test that looks at your tissues and organs using a small amount of a radioactive substance. It also checks for cancer and may help find cancer remaining in areas already treated. Using a PET scan for SBRT planning may help increase the dose of radiation given to the most resistant part of the cancer in patients with oligoprogressive NSCLC, melanoma, and RCC.",

Study doctors want to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for metastatic kidney cancer. The usual approach is defined as the care most people get for metastatic kidney cancer which includes systemic therapy such as immunotherapy (given through the veins) and/or small molecular inhibitor (tablets taken by mouth). Radiotherapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. SAbR uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. Giving SAbR prior to systemic therapy may kill more tumor cells than the usual approach, which is systemic therapy alone.",

These may include high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas; squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder; primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder; renal medullary carcinoma; or squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood and urine tests. They will have tests of heart function. They will have imaging scans. They may need a biopsy: A small needle will be used to remove a sample of tissue from the tumor.\n\nBoth SG and atezolizumab are given through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein in the arm.\n\nAll participants will receive SG on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day treatment cycle. Some participants will also receive atezolizumab on day 1 of each cycle.\n\nBlood and urine tests, imaging scans, and other exams will be repeated during study visits.\n\nTreatment may continue for up to 5 years.\n\nFollow-up visits will continue for 5 more years.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the impact of subcutaneous (SC) nivolumab given in an in-home setting to an in-clinic setting on cancer care and quality of life. Currently, most drug-related cancer care is conducted in clinic type centers or hospitals which may isolate patients from family, friends and familiar surroundings for many hours per day. This separation adds to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families. Traveling to and from medical facilities costs time, money, and effort and can be a disadvantage to patients living in rural areas, those with low incomes or poor access to transport. Studies have shown that cancer patients often feel more comfortable and secure being cared for in their own home environments. SC nivolumab in-home treatment may be safe, tolerable and/or effective when compared to in-clinic treatment and may reduce the burden of cancer and improve the quality of life in cancer patients.",

      "summary": "This phase III trial studies using risk factors in determining treatment for children with favorable tissue (histology) Wilms tumors (FHWT). Wilms Tumor is the most common type of kidney cancer in children, and FHWT is the most common subtype. Previous large clinical trials have established treatment plans that are likely to cure most children with FHWT, however some children still have their cancer come back (called relapse) and not all survive. Previous research has identified features of FHWT that are associated with higher or lower risks of relapse. The term \"risk\" refers to the chance of the cancer coming back after treatment. Using results of tumor histology tests, biology tests, and response to therapy may be able to improve treatment for children with FHWT.",

      "summary": "This phase II trial compares the safety and effectiveness of 89Zr-DFO-GmAb positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) compared to contrast-enhanced CT after surgery in detecting clear cell renal cell cancer that has come back (recurrent). For some patients, the risk of recurrence after surgery remains high. Conventional CT methods, such as contrast-enhanced CT, may not detect small volume or micrometastatic disease. PET/CT with radiotracers, such as 89Zr-DFO-GmAb, may improve detection of tumor cells. Girentuximab (GmAb), a monoclonal antibody, is tagged with zirconium-89, a radioactive atom (which is also known as an isotope). The zirconium-89 (89Zr) isotope is attached to girentuximab with desferrioxamine (DFO) and this combined product is called 89Zr-DFO-girentuximab. 89Zr-DFO-girentuximab attaches itself to a protein on the surface of clear cell renal cell tumor cells called CAIX. PET is an established imaging technique that utilizes small amounts of radioactivity attached to very minimal amounts of tracer, in the case of this research, 89Zr-DFO-GmAb. Because some cancers, including clear cell renal cell cancer, take up 89Zr-DFO-GmAb it can be seen with PET. CT utilizes x-rays that traverse body from the outside. CT images provide an exact outline of organs and potential inflammatory tissue where it occurs in patient's body. Using contrast agents with CT scan to enhance the images (contrast-enhanced CT) is standard of care imaging. 89Zr-DFO-GmAb PET/CT may be safe and effective compared to contrast-enhanced CT in detecting recurrent clear cell renal cell cancer after surgery.",

RCC is a cough that has lasted at least 8 weeks and has not resolved with standard medical treatment. BCST is a research-based treatment provided by specialty-trained speech-language pathologists (SLPs) for patients with RCC. Although the treatment works very well for a large proportion of patients in a standard one-on-one format, there are a limited number of SLPs available to provide this treatment and patients living in rural areas do not typically have access to an SLP trained in BCST. If BCST can effectively be delivered in a group telehealth model, it would significantly improve accessibility to the treatment.",

The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does the 89Zr-Girentuximab PET detect ccRCC that is left behind or has come back after treatment?\n* What differences can be seen on the 89Zr-Girentuximab PET before and after standard of care treatment?\n\nParticipants in arm 1 will be given the study drug followed by a PET scan 3-7 days after injection. Participants in arm 2 will receive the same, but will proceed with their standard of care cryoablation after the initial PET scan. Within 3 days of the cryoablation treatment, participants will receive a repeat PET scan.",

      "summary": "This study is for patients who have a type of cancer that expresses the protein CD70, which includes lymphoma (lymph gland cancer), myeloma and solid tumors including some sarcomas and kidney cancers, and the cancer has come back or has not gone away after standard of care treatment.\n\nAs there are limited or no remaining standard treatments available to treat this cancer, patients are being asked to volunteer to be in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells to create a specialized immune cell that will recognize a protein called CD70 that is expressed on the outside surface of the tumor cells in the body.\n\nThis research study combines different ways of fighting disease by using T cells and \"arming\" them to recognize a specific protein on cancer cells. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells including tumor cells. T cells by themselves have been used to treat patients with cancers and have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.\n\nThe protein used in this study is called anti-CD70. It has been developed from human CD27 on normal T cells, since it is the natural binding partner that can connect with CD70. This anti-CD70 protein sticks to tumor cells when it binds to CD70. CD70 binders have been used to treat people with different types of cancers. For this study, anti-CD70 has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When binder is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor or \"CAR T cell\". The doctors then made another change to cause these T cells to kill any cell that has CD70. This causes the \"CAR T cells\" to kill blood cancer cells which are confirmed to have CD70.\n\nIn the laboratory, investigators have found that T cells work better if there are proteins added that stimulate T cells. The anti-CD70 (CD27) protein is unique because it can bind to CD70 on tumor cells but also stimulates the T cells that express it. Adding the CD27 makes the cells grow better and may help them to last longer in the body, thus giving the cells a better chance of killing the tumor cells.\n\nThese CD70 \"CAR\" T cells are investigational products not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find a dose of CAR T cells that is safe, to learn what the side effects are and to see whether this therapy might help people with lymphoma (lymph gland cancer), myeloma and certain solid tumors including some sarcomas and kidney cancers.",
