### [NCT04974671](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04974671)

**Phase II Trial Of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Oligoprogression on Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma**

- **Sponsor**: Yale University
- **Phase**: Phase 2
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 85%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**

**Assessment:**
> The patient has a matching disease type (advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma). She meets the age and ECOG performance status criteria. She has received the required prior therapies (checkpoint inhibitors and VEGF pathway antagonists) and presents with measurable disease. However, the lack of specific lab values for hematologic and hepatic function creates a minor uncertainty, but overall this aligns with the trial eligibility.

## 🟡 MEDIUM Likelihood (2 trials)

### [NCT00001238](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00001238)

**Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL): Clinical Manifestations, Diagnosis, Management and Molecular Bases of Inherited Renal and Other Urologic Malignant Disorders**

- **Sponsor**: National Cancer Institute (NCI)
- **Phase**: N/A
- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 65%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has renal cell carcinoma, which is being studied in the trial.

- Patient has VHL loss, which could indicate a genetic basis for her disease.

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has previously been treated with multiple therapies, including ipilimumab, nivolumab, cabozantinib, lenvatinib, and everolimus. It is unclear if the trial excludes prior treatments or is for previously treated patients.

**? Uncertainties:**
- The trial eligibility criteria do not specify exclusions based on prior treatments, but a lack of clear inclusion of previously treated patients leaves some uncertainty.

- Cancer type: renal cell carcinoma is included in the conditions studied
- ECOG status: 1 is acceptable
- No brain metastases reported

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient does not meet the requirement for initial treatment given with curative intent as the patient has a metastatic disease and has progressed through multiple lines of therapy.

**? Uncertainties:**
- Need more information on whether the patient is willing to undergo regular follow-up and monitoring as per standard of care
- Need clarification on patient's willingness to provide blood samples as outlined in the study protocol

**Assessment:**
> The patient's renal cell carcinoma diagnosis matches the trial condition. However, the patient has not had initial treatment with curative intent and has significant prior therapies, which raises doubts about eligibility. This leads to a medium confidence rating.

## 🟠 LOW Likelihood (1 trials)

### [NCT05830058](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05830058)

**Phase II Randomized Controlled Trial of Biologically Guided Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Oligoprogressive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Melanoma, and Renal Cell Carcinoma**

- **Status**: Recruiting
- **Confidence**: 25%

**✓ Supporting Factors:**
- Patient has renal cell carcinoma, which is studied in the trial
- Patient has ECOG status of 1, which is acceptable for the trial

**✗ Potential Conflicts:**
- Patient has prior systemic therapies beyond the 3 months requirement with checkpoint inhibitors, while the trial likely targets patients with oligoprogressive disease after systemic therapy
- Patient has documented disease progression at various treatment lines but the trial specifically looks for 1-5 sites of oligoprogression; historical treatments may classify the patient's situation as unsuitable

**Assessment:**
> The patient's cancer type aligns with the trial's focus, but the substantial history of systemic therapies, specifically beyond the established treatment pathways for oligoprogression, raises significant concerns regarding eligibility.
